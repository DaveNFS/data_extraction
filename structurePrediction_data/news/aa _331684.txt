Klaus Kleinfeld, Chairman and CEO of Alcoa and Chairman of the USRBC said, "We

applaud President Obama for signing this bipartisan piece of legislation.  U.S.

companies will soon be guaranteed the same advantages of Russia's WTO

commitments as our foreign competitors."



Edward Verona, President and CEO of the USRBC added: "Today's historic signing

of legislation to establish Permanent Normal Trade Relations with Russia begins

a new chapter in U.S.-Russia commercial relations.  The U.S.-Russia Business

Council and its members now look forward to building upon the opportunities that

Russia's WTO accession presents."



The U.S.-Russia Business Council led the Coalition for U.S.-Russia Trade, the

organized U.S. business community effort that secured passage of the Russia PNTR

legislation in the U.S. Congress.
