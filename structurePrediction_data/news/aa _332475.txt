DATELINE: CHICAGO Oct. 26





CHICAGO, Oct. 26  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Ryerson Tull, Inc. (NYSE:RT), today

announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase Integris Metals,

Inc., a joint venture between Alcoa Inc. (NYSE:AA) and BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL).

Integris is one of North America's largest metals service centers, with a strong

position in aluminum and stainless steel.  Ryerson Tull will purchase all of the

equity interest in Integris for $410 million plus assumption of Integris' debt,

which was approximately $250 million as of October 1, 2004.  The transaction is

expected to be completed by early 2005, subject to customary closing conditions

and regulatory approval.



"This combination represents a unique opportunity to create an organization with

superior operating efficiency and unrivaled service benefits to customers," said

Neil S. Novich, Chairman, President, and CEO of Ryerson Tull.  "Together, we

will offer specialized product expertise in stainless steel, carbon steel, and

aluminum, with the ability to service customers across the United States,

Canada, and Mexico, plus a substantial processing capability in India."



This transaction enables Alcoa and BHP Billiton to exit from a non- strategic

business.



Ryerson Tull expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive. Additionally,

the company plans to capture efficiencies from the combination and generate

annualized cost savings of at least $30 million, within the next 18 to 24

months.



For 2003, Integris had revenue of $1.5 billion, net income of $10.9 million, and

earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)(1) of

$42.8 million.  With improving market conditions, Integris produced first half

2004 revenue of $969.5 million, net income of $33.5 million, and EBITDA of $64.8

million, compared to revenue of $755.7 million, net income of $6.9 million, and

EBITDA of $23.3 million, in the first half of 2003.



Ryerson Tull plans to finance the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowing

under new secured credit facilities.  Ryerson Tull intends to refinance a

portion of these borrowings with funds raised through debt and/or equity

offerings in the capital markets, as market conditions permit.



The agreement provides for a breakup fee of up to $20 million to be paid by

Ryerson Tull if the transaction is not finalized by the end of January 2005.

Ryerson Tull's preliminary estimate of goodwill associated with the acquisition

is approximately $100 million.



Note:  Ryerson Tull will conduct a conference call to discuss the acquisition of

Integris on Wednesday, October 27, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. The call will be

simulcast on the company's Web site,  http://www.ryersontull.com/ , and will be

available for two weeks following the live event.  A replay of the call can also

replay will run from Wednesday, October 27, at 12:00 noon Eastern time until
