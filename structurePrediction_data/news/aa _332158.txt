Designed as an infantry carrier, the JLTV Category B model was unveiled in

October 2007, while the Utility Vehicle Light Category C model, which is

designed with a focus on payload, was introduced in February 2008. The

prototypes are undergoing 400 to 500 miles of rigorous secondary and off-road

testing daily at a variety of facilities across the country.

combined test miles by the end of the year," said Louis DeSantis, vice president

and general manager of Ground Vehicle Systems at Lockheed Martin Systems

evidence of just how committed we are to giving the customer a mature low-risk,

and technically innovative solution that can deliver important new capabilities

to Soldiers and Marines as quickly as possible."
