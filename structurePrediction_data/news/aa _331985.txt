Transfer of Mine Permit, and Awards $2 Million to Luminant



LENGTH: 324 words



DATELINE: DALLAS, June 15





DALLAS, June 15 /PRNewswire/ -- Susman Godfrey lawyers again teamed with

colleagues from Kelly, Hart & Hallman and Energy Future Holdings Corp. ("EFH"),

this time in defeating a $50 million breach of contract claim by Alcoa against

Luminant in the 20th District Court of Milam County, Texas.



In the same case, a Milam County jury on June 2, 2010 rejected Alcoa's claims

for more than $500 million against Luminant. The jury also awarded Luminant $10

million in damages.



At the conclusion of the evidence in a bench trial on June 9, District Judge Ed

Magre ruled against Alcoa on its claim that Luminant "wasted" lignite coal at

the Three Oaks Mine, which straddles Bastrop and Lee Counties in central Texas.

The Court also ordered Alcoa to pay Luminant about $2 million for mining

services and directed Alcoa to consent to the transfer of the mine permit for

Three Oaks Mine to Luminant.



Alcoa sold Three Oaks Mine to Luminant in 2007 but kept ownership of some

lignite. Alcoa claimed that Luminant did not operate Three Oaks Mine prudently

and should have stockpiled lower-quality lignite for possible use in Luminant's

nearby power plants, Sandow Units 4 and 5.



Marshall Searcy, partner in Kelly Hart's Fort Worth office, took the lead in the

trial to the Court for EFH subsidiary Luminant Mining. The trial team consisted

of Mr. Searcy; Stacey Dore, Associate General Counsel of EFH; Chad Arnette, also

a Kelly Hart partner; and Barry Barnett and Joseph Portera of Susman Godfrey in

Dallas.



"We are pleased to have helped show that Luminant Mining fully complied with its

obligations and is entitled to transfer of the mine permit," Mr. Barnett said.

"Marshall Searcy, Stacey Dore, Chad Arnette, and Joseph Portera are terrific

lawyers, and it's been a pleasure and privilege to work with them on this

important case."
