DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., June 28, 2011





President Obama's visit to Alcoa in Davenport, Iowa, highlights the importance

of aerospace and high-technology manufacturing to our nation.



"We were pleased to hear the president acknowledge the importance of Alcoa to

our industry from the early flights of the Wright Brothers to our missions in

space and protecting our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq today," said AIA

President and CEO Marion C. Blakey. "Alcoa shares a rich heritage of supporting

our nation with other members of the Aerospace Industries Association."



The aerospace industry is a bedrock of our nation's security and competitiveness

with sales of $214.5 billion, a workforce of 624,000 and exports of $77.5

billion. The industry's $51.2 billion trade balance is the largest of any

manufacturing sector.



"We welcome President Obama's emphasis on the role of our industry in job

creation and export growth," Blakey added. "And, as the president said, our

competitiveness is dependent on the best workers having the best equipment,

which requires investment in a world-class education system and cutting-edge

innovation. We hope he takes the opportunity to visit more of our plants in the

future."



Products made in Alcoa's Davenport, Iowa factory are incorporated into a wide

variety of aerospace and defense systems, such as commercial aircraft made by

Boeing, military aircraft made by Lockheed Martin and missile technology made by

Raytheon.
