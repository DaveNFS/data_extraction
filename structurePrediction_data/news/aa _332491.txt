Interwoven, Inc. (Nasdaq: IWOV), provider of Enterprise Content Management (ECM)

solutions for business, today announced that many of its customers across

diverse industries have been selected for the CIO Magazine Agile 100, which

lists those organizations best able to combine IT agility with business agility

to adapt to rapidly changing business conditions. Interwoven is helping to

enable this agility for many of its customers today.



According to Gartner's CIO Update, "Agility equates to nimbleness when managing

transitions caused by constant business change, such as changing market

conditions." (CIO Update: CIOs Need Better IT Service and Support Metrics, Kris

Brittain, August 2004.)



For the 17th annual CIO 100 Awards, 100 organizations were selected wherein IT

agility enables agility across the enterprise. The Agile 100 honorees structure

their IT costs so that spending can flex with fluctuating demand. They use

elastic staffing and sourcing methods to align their people and resources with

changing business needs. They employ agile project processes. They create

technological agility by regularly testing new tools and developing their

employees' skills. The governance mechanisms of agile IT organizations are

proactive. Most importantly, their IT agility supports and sustains

organizational agility.



"Technology plays an increasingly important role as a strategic differentiator

in the legal industry," said Doug Caddell, CIO of Foley & Lardner, one of the

Interwoven customers awarded. "Interwoven has enabled us to pursue strategic

initiatives like client extranets that keep our firm at the forefront and help

us respond to the evolving expectations of today's legal customers."
