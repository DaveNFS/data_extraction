Top of the Market to Ya! A 2006-2014 Market Analysis



LENGTH: 254 words



DATELINE: Toronto Sept. 20





Toronto, Sept. 20  /PRNewswire/ -- Stock Traders Daily has published a 2006 -

2014 Market Analysis which shows the beginning of a prolonged down period in the

Markets.



Stock Traders Daily has made this report available to Institutions and

Accredited Investors through Radio presentations, Interviews, and affiliated

Financial Networks.



"This is a demographic analysis" said Thomas H. Kee Jr., Author of the report.

"We identify the Investment Rate and use it to predict Market cycles. This

method has worked perfectly in the past."



In February 2002 Stock Traders Daily produced a similar report which predicted

the fair value of the Market within 4 points. "We called fair value at 773 in

February 2002, it was 768.63 in October. We hit the nail on the head," said Mr

Kee.



The 2006 report shows the beginning of a down period and it predicts a peak in

the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This report encompasses all of the Dow 30

stocks. Some of these include: Alocoa (TSX: AA; NYSE: AA), 3M Company (TSX: MMM;

NYSE: MMM), Altria Group (TSX: MO; NYSE: MO), American Express (TSX: AXP; NYSE:

AXP), American International Group (TSX: AIG; NYSE: AIG), just to name a few.



But the down period won't be limited to just the Dow 30, in Mr. Kee's opinion.
