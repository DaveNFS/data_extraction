WASHINGTON, April 27, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- AFSCME recommends that

shareholders of Alcoa vote AGAINST ratifying executive pay and FOR annual

director elections at the Alcoa shareholder meeting May 6. AFSCME urges

ConocoPhillips shareholders to vote AGAINST executive pay and FOR lobbying

payments disclosure at the ConocoPhillips shareholder meeting May 11.

AFSCME has led the charge to get shareholders of U.S. companies the right to

vote on executive pay. Thanks to the Wall Street Reform Act, shareholders now

have a voice. "Shareowners are using Say on Pay to register their disapproval of

skyrocketing CEO pay," said AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee, whose 1.6

million members participate in public pension funds with combined assets worth

more than $1 trillion. "Investors can use this tool judiciously and send a clear

message to boards of directors: Pay needs to be tied to performance."



Despite underperforming its peers over one- and three-year time frames, Alcoa

raised the total pay of Chairman and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld each year during his

three-year tenure. While Kleinfeld earned more than $35 million from when he

became CEO in May 2008 until 2010, Alcoa shares lost more than 60 percent of

their value during this period.



Although ConocoPhillips is smaller than all of the companies it selected for

benchmarking CEO total compensation, its CEO pay is the second highest of the

group. In setting total compensation targets, the Compensation Committee uses

Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Chevron for benchmarking purposes. These

choices result in outsize pay for a total shareholder return that underperforms

its peers over three and five years.



"Cherry-picking peers to raise target compensation is a major reason CEO pay

continues its inexorable rise," added McEntee. "Compensation committees need to

stop playing these games."



AFSCME's 1.6 million members provide the vital services that make America

happen. With members in hundreds of different occupations - from nurses to

corrections officers, childcare providers to sanitation workers - AFSCME

advocates for fairness in the workplace, excellence in public services and

prosperity and opportunity for all working families.
