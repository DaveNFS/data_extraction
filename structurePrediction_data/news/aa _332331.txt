The SAE Foundation's A World In Motion(R) (AWIM) program is the recipient of a

$102,020 pledge from The Alcoa Foundation.



Through AWIM, math and science come to life for students in grades 4 through 10.

AWIM provides interactive learning experiences through its "Challenges" (its

series of four cirricula). Each AWIM Challenge is designed around a current

math, science, and/or technology standard.



The funds from Alcoa will be used to host teacher training sessions for the

Challenge 1 modules, designed for grades 4 through 6, for school districts in

Nashville and Cleveland.



"We very much appreciate Alcoa Foundation's donation to the A World In Motion

program," Carson Walburn, SAE Foundation Director, said. "This generous

contribution shows the commitment that the Alcoa Foundation has to supporting

math and science education."



A part of SAE International, the SAE Foundation supports and nurtures students'

enthusiasm for science and technology through educational outreach programs,

awards and scholarships. Programs such as A World In Motion and the Collegiate

Design Series offer hands-on learning through fun and challenging curricula to

elementary school and college students.
