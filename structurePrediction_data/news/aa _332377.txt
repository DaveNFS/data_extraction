CORONA, Calif., May 22  /PRNewswire/ -- Dennis Higgs, President of Newcastle

Partners, announced today the sale of Rincon Business Park in Corona,

California.  Partnered with HG Capital on the acquisition and development of the

project, Newcastle Partners purchased the 242,000 square foot building in May of

2004.



According to Mr. Higgs, the project consisted of one large

industrial/manufacturing building, scheduled for demolition and redevelopment

into a state-of-the-art business park.  The building was formally owned and

occupied by Alcoa Aluminum.  Newcastle Partners master planned and designed the

business park development and decided to sell the project prior to construction

based upon market conditions.



Newcastle recently completed a successful 420,000 square foot, three building

industrial park development in Fontana, California that sold out prior to

construction completion, an 115,000 square foot, eight building business/office
