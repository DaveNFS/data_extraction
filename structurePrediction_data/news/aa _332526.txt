DATELINE: CAMPBELL, Calif. Feb. 23





FineGround, the leader in web application optimization, today announced its

Alcoa Aluminio S.A., the South American division of Alcoa, the leading

manufacturer of aluminum products selected its Velocity(TM) appliance. The

FineGround Velocity appliance provides end-to-end accelerated performance to

over 5,000 Alcoa Aluminio employees accessing the Plumtree employee portal

application.



"Our goal was to provide faster accessibility to corporate data, increase

productivity and employee collaboration," said Sergio Fabossi, IT Consultant at

Alcoa Aluminio S.A. "We required an easy to implement appliance allowing us to

improve business productivity and reduce response times end-to-end. FineGround's

solution enabled critical corporate information to be accessed by all employees

regardless of location and time zone."



Alcoa Aluminio was faced with slow performance of their employee portal which

led to user complaints and poor application usage at various plant locations in

South America. Without adequate performance, employees were not able to access

the portal 24x7, and employee productivity was impacted. FineGround provided

Alcoa Aluminio the flexibility to address application performance with its

server-side appliance offering, Velocity. Designed for easy deployment, the

FineGround Velocity operates transparently with both the network and its

applications. Rather than investing in additional server infrastructure and

bandwidth resources at the portal application, Alcoa Aluminio sought a

centralized, cost-effective appliance offering.



"For manufacturers with globally dispersed locations, providing employees access

to the right information quickly is essential to boosting productivity and

increasing business performance," said Jay Mellman, vice president of marketing

at FineGround Networks. "Our software and appliance offerings enable enterprises

to not only monitor real-time user experience but act upon that data and deliver

faster access to business-critical information, all without requiring changes to

the IT infrastructure."
