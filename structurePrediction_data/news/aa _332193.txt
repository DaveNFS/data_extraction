WASHINGTON, May 12 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- This week, the House Armed Services

Committee will vote on legislation that will have a direct economic impact on

the state of Iowa. The committee, which includes Iowa Congressman Dave Loebsack

among its members, will consider funding for the KC-45, the U.S. Air Force's

next generation aerial refueling tanker.



On Feb. 29, the Air Force selected Northrop Grumman Corporation(NYSE:NOC)to

provide that tanker. Northrop Grumman has engaged 230 suppliers in 49 states to

assist with the project. Those suppliers will support 48,000 new direct and

indirect jobs, including 171 in Iowa, generating $11.6 million in new economic

activity in the state.



"We're proud that the people of Iowa will be participating in the effort to

provide the Air Force with the tanker," said Paul Meyer, vice president of Air

Mobility Systems for Northrop Grumman. "We're also proud that Northrop Grumman

can provide an economic boost to Iowa."



Suppliers in Iowa that will participate in the development of the Northrop

Grumman KC-45 include Alcoa in Riverdale and Rockwell Collins in Cedar Rapids.
