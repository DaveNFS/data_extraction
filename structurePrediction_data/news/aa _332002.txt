DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11





WASHINGTON, March 11 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- During a 12 week period, over

105 million beverage cans, or more than 3 million pounds of recycled cans,

raised over $2.3 million for Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross, Toys

for Tots, local parks, other non-profit groups, schools and recycling programs

through the Aluminum Can Council's (ACC) America Recycles Day Challenge. The

America Recycles Day Challenge is a friendly, intra-industry contest where

aluminum suppliers Alcoa Inc., Arco Aluminum and Novelis Inc. and beverage can

manufacturers: Ball Corporation; Metal Container Corporation and Rexam compete

to see which facility can recycle the most aluminum cans per employee. In 2009,

30 aluminum supplier and beverage can manufacturing facilities participated in

the contest.

The aluminum can is the most recycled beverage package in the world and events

like the America Recycles Day (ARD) Challenge are aimed at increasing the

recycling rate and highlighting the sustainable benefits of the aluminum

beverage can. The 3 million pounds of aluminum recycled during the ACC ARD

Challenge saved 196,576 MBTUs of energy, reduced the equivalent amount of

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by 2,314 cars driven in one year, saved

7,723 cubic meters of water and conserved 12,637 metric tons of GHG versus using

new aluminum.(1)



The America Recycles Day Challenge continues to raise recycling awareness and

reinforce the industry's commitment to sustainability, the environment and

supporting local businesses and charities in the community. According to Robert

Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, "ACC members really

stepped up to the challenge in 2009, recycling 679 percent more aluminum

beverage cans than they did in 2008. This is such a positive example of

sustainable initiatives."



Rexam's Chatsworth, California beverage can plant recycled over 34 million

aluminum beverage cans, or 1,010,118 pounds, to win the America Recycles Day

Challenge. This is a record since the inception of the America Recycles Day

Challenge program in 2003. The Chatsworth plant worked with local organizations,

including a partnership with the Valley Recycling Center and the San Fernando

Valley Habitat for Humanity, to incorporate recycling efforts into concerts,

runs and other fundraisers.



Second place went to Rexam's beverage plant in Fairfield, California recycling

560,788 pounds of beverage cans. Third place honors went to Rexam's beverage can

plant in St. Paul, Minnesota, recycling 565,087 pounds of beverage cans.



The Novelis plant in LaGrange, Georgia bested the competition in the

Mayor/Municipal Recycling Outreach Category, recycling 12,963 pounds of used

beverage cans, or 1,296 pounds per employee. ARCO Aluminum, Louisville, Kentucky

was second, recycling 17,580 pounds, or 517 pounds per employee.



"We want to thank the ACC for initiating this industry-wide contest and giving

the aluminum beverage can industry a platform to show our local communities how

easy and important it is to recycle," said Andre Balbi, president and CEO, Rexam

Beverage Can Americas. "We were very pleased with our plants' efforts and we are

proud to join U.S. can makers and aluminum sheet suppliers in asserting the

aluminum can as the most sustainable and environmentally-friendly beverage

package in the world."
