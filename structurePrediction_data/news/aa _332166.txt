TRINIDAD & TOBAGO, and BOSTON, Aug. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- CariSal Investment

Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries ("CariSal") and Denham Capital ("Denham")

announced today that Denham will make an equity investment of up to $50 million

in CariSal, an investment holding company that includes CariSal, LLC, a leading

manufacturer of ClearPath(TM) ice-melt products, and CariSal Unlimited, a future

producer of calcium chloride and caustic soda.



CariSal, which was formed in September 2005, aims to be a leading supplier of

caustic soda, calcium chloride and other related products to Trinidad, the

Caribbean, Latin America and North America, and West Africa, for the oilfield

services, road construction, ice-melt, and other markets. CariSal also supplies

ClearPath(TM) to the US ice-melt market. It has operations in Middletown, New

York and Trinidad and Tobago.



Denham's investment is critical to the completion of a calcium chloride/ caustic

soda complex to be constructed in Point Lisas, Trinidad. The facility will

nominally produce 100,000 mt caustic soda, 70,000 mt pure pellet and 78,000 mt

pure flake calcium chloride per annum.



The CariSal facility is scheduled for commercial operation by early 2010 and

will be the second largest dry calcium chloride plant in the Western Hemisphere

and the largest caustic soda plant in the West Indies. The company has signed a

10-year agreement with Alcoa World Alumina LLC to supply caustic soda from the

plant upon completion.



"Securing Denham Capital as our primary equity partner is an important step in

achieving our long-term strategic plans and will enable CariSal to grow with our

customers' forecasted requirements," said Richard Lietzau, CEO of CariSal. "This

investment, in combination with contractual agreements with our major customers,

such as Alcoa, provides CariSal with tremendous financial and commercial

strength for our long-term growth plans in Trinidad and other regions of the

world."



"CariSal's facility in Point Lisas, Trinidad is one of the best positioned

calcium chloride and caustic soda manufacturing facilities in the world with

access to a workforce trained in downstream plant construction, management and

operations and also the ability to service North American, South American and

Caribbean end markets," said Bill Zartler, Managing Partner and head of the

Energy Infrastructure Group at Denham Capital. "This investment continues to

expand Denham's downstream footprint and enables us to take advantage of the

extensive growth opportunities in the global calcium chloride and caustic soda

markets."



Denham will gain majority ownership of CariSal through its investment. The

existing CariSal management team will continue to be responsible for managing

the operations of the company.
