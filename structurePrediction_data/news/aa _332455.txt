MARKET OVERVIEW



Trading overseas is rather bleak this morning, as only two of the 15 markets

that we follow in positive territory.  As of 7:52 a.m., the cumulative average

return comes in at a negative 0.528 percent.



The May contract on sweet crude oil added seven cents per barrel on Friday's

regular trading session.  But the big news is today's pre-market move above the

$58 level, as crude prices appear to be on a juggernaut toward the $60 level.

Fueled by supply and demand concerns, the May contract has tagged $58.10 per

barrel in early morning trading even as OPEC continues to mull another

500,000-barrel-per-day production hike. In other news in the oil pits,

ChevronTexaco confirmed that it has agreed to acquire Unocal for $18 billion in

stock, cash, and debt assumption. The deal values Unocal shares at $62 each. As

a part of the deal, Unocal shareholders will receive either 1.03 shares of

ChevronTexaco or $65 in cash. ChevronTexaco also expects to issue 210 million

shares in the deal and pay $4.4 billion in cash.
