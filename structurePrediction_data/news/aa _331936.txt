Lockheed Martin JLTV Platform Maturity Grows Beyond 145,000 Combined Testing

Miles



LENGTH: 410 words



DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 24, 2011





Lockheed Martin's (NYSE: LMT) Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) has reached a

key maturity milestone, accumulating over 145,000 combined internal and

government testing miles across its family of vehicles. U.S. Army and Marine

teams continue to accumulate durability miles as part of a 12-month test and

evaluation phase at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Md., and Yuma Proving Grounds in

Yuma, Ariz.



"Reaching 145,000 combined testing miles shows that our vehicle design is mature

and robust, and can stand up to the harsh conditions in which they will

operate," said Scott Greene, vice president of Ground Vehicles at Lockheed

Martin Missiles and Fire Control. "Our commitment to performance is equal to our

commitment to affordability, and those qualities will only improve as we

continue to optimize our design for an Engineering and Manufacturing Development

proposal later this year."



Ten Lockheed Martin JLTV variants are undergoing government evaluations, as part

of the Technology Development (TD) phase of the JLTV program, expected to

conclude in May.



"Our JLTV family of vehicles has delivered consistent performance throughout the

TD phase," Greene said. "TD offers challenging mobility and reliability trials

that have pushed our vehicles to the extreme, and we're proud of the

dependability and maturity our platform has demonstrated to the customer."



Lockheed Martin leads a team pursuing the JLTV program, a joint services effort

to return advanced mobility, protection and payload to deployed troops by

replacing a portion of the aging High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle

(Humvee) fleet. The JLTV program creates a common family of vehicles consisting

of the Combat Tactical Vehicle and Combat Support Vehicle, both with multiple

variants and associated companion trailers.



Formed in 2005, the Lockheed Martin-led JLTV team includes BAE Systems Global

Tactical Systems, Alcoa Defense and JWF-Defense Systems.



Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin is a global security company

that employs about 132,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the

research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of

advanced technology systems, products and services. The Corporation's 2010 sales

from continuing operations were $45.8 billion.
