DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22





WASHINGTON, June 22 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The U.S. Department of Labor

today announced the certification of 20 petitions for benefit eligibility for

workers under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, which provides

training and employment services for workers who have lost their jobs due to

competitive foreign trade. These are the first certifications under the new TAA

law that took effect on May 18, 2009, which, among other changes, expanded

program access to previously ineligible service industry workers.



"These certifications mark the beginning of a new era of opportunity for service

workers who lose their jobs as a result of direct foreign competition," said

Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. "Workers covered under TAA are offered the

employment and training services needed to upgrade existing skills or pursue new

careers in growing industries."



The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) expanded the

pool of eligible TAA recipients to include: workers in companies that supply

services; workers whose companies have shifted production to any foreign

country; workers in public agencies; workers whose companies produce component

parts of a finished product; workers in companies that supply testing,

packaging, maintenance and transportation services to companies with

TAA-certified workers; and workers whose companies are identified in an

International Trade Commission "injury" determination listed in the Trade Act of

1974. The Recovery Act also raised the cap on annual TAA training funds from

$220 million to $575 million.



Workers experiencing a loss or decrease in employment due to trade may submit a

petition to the Department of Labor for certification. Workers certified as

eligible for TAA have access to a variety of resources such as re-employment

services, job search allowances, relocation allowances and various types of

income support.



Expanded TAA has resulted in more than 1,200 petitions filed since May 18,

compared with137 petitions filed during the same period in 2008. Determinations

for pending applications are forthcoming.
