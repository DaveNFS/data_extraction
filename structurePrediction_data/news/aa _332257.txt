One hundred thirteen students attended the five-day, 40-hour courses at TTCI's

Emergency Response Training Center, which provides training in classes that

simulate train, truck and barge accidents. Located on 52 square miles of

isolated high desert, the TTCI campus includes 48 miles of specialized tracks to

test locomotives, vehicles, track components and signal devices. Some 80 rail

cars, intermodal and highway vehicles, and containers are used to provide

realistic training exercises.



Participants received hands-on training to assess tank car damage, make repairs

and transfer hazardous materials from damaged equipment. Students practiced

wearing protective clothing and using self-contained breathing apparatus. For

their final exercise, they participated in a simulated hazardous-material

accident in order to learn how to work with railroads during emergencies and how

to stay safe while on railroad property.



Since 1998, NS has sponsored 17 training programs at TTCI that have been

attended by 712 emergency responders, NS employees and contractors. Norfolk

Southern also offers free hazardous material training programs to the

communities it serves. These classes have reached 34,183 emergency responders

since 1997.
