NEW YORK, Feb. 22  /PRNewswire/ -- Iceland, a nation primarily known for its

geothermal spas and unspoiled nature, is quickly gaining attention for other

attractive traits: a suddenly booming investment structure and huge incentives

for U.S. businesses. The Icelandic-American Chamber of Commerce (IACC) will host

a one-day conference and luncheon identifying Icelandic investment opportunities

with guest speakers covering a range of topics, from Iceland's hottest sectors

and low energy costs, to bank privatization and tourism. IACC Chairman and Time

Warner Executive Vice President Olafur Johann Olafsson will join Icelandic

Minister of Industry and Commerce Valgerdur Sverrisdottir, and Goldman Sachs

Vice President and Senior Economist Ed McKelvey, among others, as speakers and

moderators for the event.



Other companies represented: Actavis, ALCOA, Century Aluminum, FL Group,

Landsbanki Islands, Nordic Investment Bank, Ossur, Sjova, and Straumur- Burdaras

Investment Bank.



Iceland, America's closest European neighbor, ranks fifth in the 2006 Index of

Economic Freedom, published by The Wall Street Journal and the World Heritage

Foundation. It tied with the U.K., and was well ahead of 11th-ranked U.S. What's

more, the country ranks fourth in competitiveness worldwide according to the IMD

World Competitiveness Yearbook 2005, following the U.S., Hong Kong and

Singapore.
