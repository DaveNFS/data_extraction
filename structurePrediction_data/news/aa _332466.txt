RUSAL Reports Production Results for 2004

DATELINE: MOSCOW January 27





MOSCOW, January 27  /PRNewswire/ -- RUSAL, one of the world's leading aluminium

producers, today announced 2004 production results for the full year 2004. Key

results for the past year include a significant expansion of the raw material

base, strong volume growth in added-value aluminium products and implementation

of the outsourcing program for service functions.



The most significant development for RUSAL in 2004 was the progress made on the

key strategic goal of expanding the company's raw material base and achieving

self-sufficiency in raw materials. In 2004 alumina output was 3,140,002 tons, a

5.3% increase over 2003. This was the result of capacity expansion at RUSAL's

Nikolaev Alumina Refinery and performance improvement at the company's Achinsk

Alumina Refinery. Bauxite production was 4,867,271 tonnes, an 11.9% increase

over 2003.



Commenting on the production results, Alexander Bulygin, RUSAL's Chief Executive

Officer, said, "We are pleased with these full year production figures. The

production growth at our smelters and refineries has more than matched our

expectations and underlines the significant year-on-year progress RUSAL

continues to make. Much of this growth has come from the commitment to

investment and modernisation projects the company made some time ago. I look

forward to seeing the current investments and projects deliver similarly

impressive results in the future. As we begin 2005, RUSAL is committed to

continuing its investment in infrastructure and people, identifying greater

efficiencies and securing new sources of raw materials as we look to cement our

position as one of the world's leading aluminium companies."



The most significant contribution to the expansion of RUSAL's raw material base

is the pending acquisition of a 20% share in Queensland Alumina Ltd. in

Australia, the largest alumina refinery in the world. This acquisition, along

with the purchase of the Bauxitogorsk alumina refinery completed in December

2004, will enable the company to increase alumina output volumes by more than

25%.



Further raw material projects include the exploration and production of bauxite

at three deposits belonging to the North Onega bauxite group, with overall

reserves of over 800 mln tonnes. RUSAL won the license to develop these in an

auction in December 2004.



Production of primary aluminium in 2004 amounted to 2,670,967 tonnes, a 3.1%

year-on-year increase. The increase was as a result of production expansion,

investment in new equipment, the introduction of new technologies and the

improvement of performance indicators. RUSAL obtained approval from the Russian

Government to sell two rolling mills to Alcoa - Samara Metal Works and

Belaya-Kalitva Metallurgical Production Association, an important step in

allowing RUSAL to focus on its core business producing primary aluminium and

alloys.



RUSAL continues to increase the share of value-added casthouse products in the

overall production total, with the aim of meeting a 50% share by 2013. In 2004

the volume of value-added casthouse product output increased by 33.5% to approx.

740,000 tonnes. The share of these products in the overall aluminium production

total in 2004 was 17%, a 6.4% increase over 2003. This trend enables the company

to better focus on the individual needs of each customer by manufacturing new

types of alloys. Today RUSAL's plants produce over 80 varieties of alloys. RUSAL

is also increasing its sales to the domestic market. In 2004 these increased by

38,000 and accounted for 18% of total sales.



In February a new beverage can plant, ROSTAR-Vsevolzhsk, began operations. The

plant's designed annual capacity is 1,700 mln. half-liter cans. Total investment

into the plant was US$100 mln. With introduction of ROSTAR-Vsevolzhsk the

growing demand on the Russian market is now fully satisfied by domestic

production. The launch of the new plant strengthened RUSAL's position in the

Russian beverage can market. RUSAL's market share rose to 60%.



In 2004 RUSAL took a decision to participate in various power projects to

provide the company's smelters with their own power. The first project committed

to is in Tajikistan. An agreement signed with the Tajikistan Government in

October 2004 will enable RUSAL to participate in the construction of the

Rogunskaya hydropower plant. The agreement also includes construction of a new

aluminium smelter with a 200,000-tonne capacity and the installation of two new

potrooms with 100,000 tonne capacity at Tajik Aluminium Smelter.



In 2004 RUSAL continued consolidation of the company and its buyout of shares

from plant minority shareholders. This included the purchase of minority stakes

in Krasnoyarsk.



RUSAL's specialists have developed what is currently the most powerful cell in

Russia, with amperage of 300 kA. Top Russian research capabilities combined with

international experience were used to develop the cell. The cell is capable of

producing over 2,050 kilos.



In 2004 RUSAL completed its program to outsource auxiliary services. Seven

subsidiaries have been created to take responsibility for repair and maintenance

of technological and energy equipment at RUSAL's smelters and alumina

refineries. This facilitated reduced repair time and costs.



Creation of aluminium and alumina divisions completed the company's structural

optimization and enabled streamlining of the management of aluminium and alumina

plants of the group. Introduction of SAP R/3 system at Krasnoyarsk helped to

further optimize financial operations, supply management, data analysis,

decision-making processes and business planning. The next step will be

introduction of SAP R/3 in the Moscow headquarters and then at all RUSAL

facilities.



Financial highlights



2004 was a favourable year for the metallurgical business. It was characterized

by stable high prices and steady demand for aluminium on the one hand, but

higher power prices and a weak dollar on the other. These factors were reflected

in the company's costs. RUSAL's revenues increased by 20% to US$5.4 billion from

US$4.5 billion in 2003, resulting from increased LME aluminium prices, as well

as a continuing rise in RUSAL's aluminium output and improved product mix. The

company's revenues in international markets in 2004 increased 16% over 2003 and

amounted to US$4.3 bln. The company's sales on the domestic market increased by

32.5% year on year and amounted to US$1.1 bln. Investments in 2004 increased to

US$534 mln from US$284 mln in 2003. Investments in modernizaion in 2004 amounted

to US$278 mln versus US$180 mln in 2003.



In 2004 RUSAL closed the syndication of an US$800 mln term loan facility for

pre-export financing. This loan is the largest loan facility ever obtained by a

mining/metallurgical company in Russia.



Outlook for 2005



Growth will remain the main strategic focus in 2005, and RUSAL will continue to

look for merger and acquisition opportunities in both the alumina and aluminium

sectors. In 2005 RUSAL is planning to invest about US$1.5 bln in growing its

business.



RUSAL will concentrate on the following projects in 2005:



- Preparatory work for a new aluminium smelter in Irkustsk will continue, with

construction due to start in 2006.



- A feasibility study to build a new alumina refinery at the Severnaya Onega

bauxite deposit will begin.



- The Armenal plant will recommence production following a comprehensive

modernization programme.



  - The development of a new RA-400 cell will be completed.

   - Construction will begin on the Rogunsk power plant (Tajikistan).





- Expansion of the Nikolaev and Achinsk refineries to 1.6 and 1.2 mln tonnes

respectively, will begin.



- A feasibility study to expand the Friguia alumina refinery (Guinea) will be

completed.

   Environment





- RUSAL continued ISO 14001 environmental certification of its plants, with

Achinsk and Nikolayev Alumina Refinery, Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter

receiving certification in 2004. Eight of RUSAL's production units are now ISO

14001 certified and those remaining are awaiting certification.



- As part of the Bratsk Smelter modernization all 25 potrooms were transferred

to dry anode technology.



- Potroom No. 10 at the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter has been successfully

transferred to dry anode technology. RUSAL plans to transfer all the potrooms at

Krasnoyarsk to dry anode technology, which will substantially reduce emissions.

16 potrooms at Krasnoyarsk are already using this technology.
