Since inception in 1988, the S&P 500 has outperformed the Zacks #5 Rank List of

continued to tout stocks during the market declines of the last few years, Zacks

told investors which stocks to sell or avoid.

Rank universe:

cents per share on July 28, which came in 3 cent wider than the average

share from $1.20 per share over the past two months. For 2012, analysts expect a

posted on September 12, lagged analysts' projections by 3.33%. Estimate for

current year slid 11 cents per share to $2.39 per share over a month as next

year's estimate dipped 12 cents per share to $2.68 per share in that time span.

About the Zacks Rank



Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate revisions are the

most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since inception in 1988, #1 Rank

Stocks have generated an average annual return of +28%. During the 2000-2002

bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%, while the S&P 500 tumbled

-37.6%. Also note that the Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell

recommendations (Rank #5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988,

Zacks Rank #5 stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (2.8% versus

+9.7%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage portfolio

trading effectively.
