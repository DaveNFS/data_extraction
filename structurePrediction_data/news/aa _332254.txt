"If you want to find out which companies are going to change the world, look at

the Inc. 500," said Inc. Editor Jane Berentson. "These are the most innovative,

dynamic, fast-growth companies in the nation, the ones coming up with solutions

to some of our most intractable ills, creating systems that let us conduct

business faster and easier, and manufacturing products we soon discover we can't

live without. The Inc. 500 list is Inc. magazine's tribute to American business

ingenuity and ambition," continued Berentson.

"FMS is honored to be recognized as one of the fastest growing private companies

in the USA. Obtaining a rank in the top 50% of the 2007 Inc. 500 came as a very

pleasant surprise," stated Cliff Henley, CEO of FMS. "Like most honorees, FMS

did not set out to make a list such as this one, as we were, and still are

focused on growing the business and executing on our model 24/7/365. This type

of recognition and reward is simply a result of a dedicated team, all of which

are champions in their field and true evangelists of FMS," continued Henley.
