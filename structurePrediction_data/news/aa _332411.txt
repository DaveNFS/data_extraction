U.S. stocks closed sharply higher Thursday as a raft of inflation-friendly data

sparked a rally in technology shares and handed the Dow Jones Industrial Average

its first triple-digit gain in more than a month.



Metals prices also kept up their bullish pace, and gold closed above $500, a

feat not seen since 1987.



The Dow rose 106.70 points, or 1%, to 10,912.57, its first gain of more than 100

points since Oct. 28.



The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 34.35 points, or 1.5%, to 2,267.17. The

tech-rich index put in its best one-day performance in six weeks.



The S&P 500 Index tacked on 15.19 points to close at 1,264.67.



"You seem to be getting this period where growth is coming through, but it isn't

aggravating inflation and thereby long-bond yields," said Jim Paulsen, chief

investment officer at Wells Capital Management. "For the stock market, there's

not a lot that can be better than that."



Among components of the Dow, McDonald's rallied to a 5 1/2-year high of $35.38

as investors bet that higher personal incomes and consumer spending will bode

well for the fast-food giant.



Alcoa climbed as much as 3.2% to $28.28 amid a broad rally in metals.



Intel rose 1.9% to $27.18 after analysts at Bear Stearns said the company likely

will raise its fourth-quarter revenue outlook when it provides a midquarter

update on Dec. 8. That helped semiconductor stocks put in their best one-day

gain in nearly 10 months, surging more than 4%.



Not all was happy within the Dow component stocks. Wal-Mart fell as much as 2.1%

to $47.53 after the discount retailer said it expects December same-store sales

in the range of 2% to 4%, which is a narrower forecast range than its November

target of 3% to 5% same-store sales growth.



On the broader market for equities, advancers outpaced decliners by more than

three to one on the New York Stock Exchange and by more than two to one on the

Nasdaq.



Energy and oil services stocks also rallied strongly.



Volume was heavy with 1.86 billion shares traded on the Big Board, while 1.52

billion were exchanged on the Nasdaq. On a historical basis, investors can look

forward to further gains in December after a solid performance in November. On

average, the Dow industrials has gained 1.8% in December since 1950, according

to the Stock Trader's Almanac.



  The Nasdaq Composite has risen 2.1% while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7%.



  Inflation-friendly data





Stocks got a boost from data showing a modest increase in U.S. personal incomes

and spending in October while inflationary pressures eased.



Personal incomes increased 0.4% in October as expected, after rising 1.7% in

September, the Commerce Department said. Real (inflation-adjusted) spending

increased 0.1% in October, the first increase in three months. Consumer prices

rose 0.1% in October after soaring 0.9% in September.



Also, first-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell sharply in the

latest week, the Labor Department reported. The number of initial claims fell

17,000 to 320,000 in the week ended November 26. The decline was larger than

forecast. Economists had expected claims to fall to 323,000, according to a

survey conducted by MarketWatch.



The nation's manufacturing sector continued to expand in November, but at a

slower pace than in October. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing

index fell to 58.1% from 59.1% in October. Economists polled by MarketWatch had

been expecting the index to fall to 57.8%. The data also offered some good news

for those investors worried about inflation. The price index, a component of the

ISM report, fell sharply.



Spending on U.S. construction projects rose a stronger-than-expected 0.7% in

October as public-sector outlays jumped, the Commerce Department.



Metals rally



Gold futures climbed to an 18-year high above $500 for the first time in 18

years in New York trading; silver prices closed at their loftiest level since

1987 and copper rose to new heights for the fourth-day in a row.



"The strength in the metals sector is now undeniable as gold crosses key

technical barriers and approaches levels it hasn't seen in decades," said

commodities trader Kevin Kerr, who also edits Global Resources Trade, a

newsletter service of MarketWatch, the publisher of this report.



"The demand is real and at these levels of pricing, we expect to see a sustained

rise in 2006," Kerr said. Gold for December rose $7.90 to close at $502.50 an

ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.



Dollar, bonds, oil



On the currency markets, the dollar held its own against the euro even after the

European Central Bank raised short-term interest by a quarter percentage point

to 2.25%, the first increase in five years. The decision was widely expected.



At last check, the euro was down 0.8% at $1.1708. Against the Japanese yen, the

greenback climbed to a more than two-year high, up 0.7% to 120.50 yen.



On the bond market, long-term Treasury prices slumped for a third day as

fixed-income traders switched attention from bond-friendly inflation readings to

forecasts that November's employment report will show a strong month for job

creation when it is released Friday. The benchmark 10-year note was down 9/32 at

99 26/32, with its yield at 4.53% vs. 4.49% on Wednesday.



Crude futures rose on government data showing the first significant decline in

heating fuel inventories for the season. The benchmark January contract ended up

$1.15, or 2%, at $58.47 a barrel in New York trading.



More declines in auto sales



The auto sector came into focus as carmakers released their U.S. vehicle sales

for November.



General Motors Corp posted an 11% decline in U.S. sales. Car sales fell 3% vs. a

year ago, but truck sales plummeted 16%. The stock rose 71 cents, or 3.2% at

$22.61.



Ford Motor shares were off 3 cents at $8.10 after it reported a 15% decline in

November sales. Car sales fell 7% while truck sales slumped 18%.



DaimlerChrysler saw a smaller 3% decline in U.S. sales. The stock was up 69

cents at $50.98. Japanese carmakers turned in mixed results Toyota Motor Corp

posted a 4.5% rise in November, besting its U.S. rivals. Nissan North America,

however, saw its sales tumble 7.8%.



Retailers in focus



Consumers were bargain shoppers last month, shifting much spending to retailers

like Wal-Mart Stores and J.C. Penney that offered the deepest discounts and the

most aggressive marketing devices.



Wal-Mart shares were down on its December outlook but its November same-stores

growth of 4.3% was in line with expectations. Same-store sales, a common measure

of retail performance, logs sales from stores open at least a year.



Rival Target Corp. saw same-store sales rise 2.6% in November. The retailer's

shares rose 29 cents to $53.80.



J.C. Penney shares gained, with same-store sales up 3.6%, nearly double the 1.9%

expectation. The stock closed out the session up 4.6% at $54.87.



Pier 1 Imports warned of a third-quarter loss, although the home-furnishings

retailer posted a 1.9% rise November same-store sales on improving traffic and

an increase in the average sale to customers. The stock tumbled 8.5% to $11.62.



There was mixed news out of the Gap Inc. The apparel giant saw a 4% decline in

same-store sales as traffic remained "challenging" at its Gap and Banana

Republic chains. The company said traffic trends improved at its Old Navy

stores. The stock ended up 2 cents at $17.40.



Elsewhere, Dow Chemical Co. shares fell as much as 2.2% to $44.24 after Lehman

Bros. downgraded the company to equal-weight from overweight, citing lower

expectations for its ethylene and propylene businesses in 2006. The stock

finally trimmed losses to end down 34 cents at $44.91.
