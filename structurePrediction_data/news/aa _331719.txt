 Big Week for Economic Data



Economic reports dominate the news flow this week, with the September non-farm

payroll report coming out on Friday as the most significant. The tepid pace of

jobs improvement has been a persistent source of frustration for investors. But

the loss of momentum in the manufacturing sector in recent months has added to

those worries. The two ISM surveys on deck this week will give a good sense of

where the factory and service sectors stood.



Alcoa's (NYSE: AA ) release the following week will 'unofficially' kick-off the

third reporting season, but we 'officially' count all companies that have

financial quarters ending in August as part of our third quarter results tally.

As such, recent earnings from reports FedEx (NYSE: FDX ), Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL

), Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and others are part of the 'official' third quarter tally.



That said, it is the very early going at this stage. We will need to wait two to

three more weeks to get a sense of the third quarter reporting season.



We have a total of 16 companies reporting results this week, including five S&P

500 companies. Expectations for the third quarter remain quite low, with total

earnings expected to drop 3% from the same period last year. This growth

expectation reflects a 2.4% drop in total revenues and a 10-basis point

expansion in net margins.



The actual growth rates will most likely be better than these pre-season

expectations, given how company managements have refined the art of

under-promising and over-delivering quarter after quarter. Just to give you an

idea of how good they are at anchoring expectations, roughly two-thirds of the

companies in the S&P 500 would typically beat earnings expectations in any given

quarter - it was 62% in the second quarter and 65% in the first quarter.



If we do get negative earnings growth this quarter as currently expected, that

will be the first decline in quarterly earnings since the earnings recovery got

underway after the end of the Great Recession in 2009. The earnings weakness is

quite broad-based, with half of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have negative

earnings growth.



As was the case in the second quarter, the Energy and Basic Material sectors are

the weakest, with earnings declines of 24.9% and 22.3%, respectively. Energy and

Basic Materials earnings were down 16% and 20.5% respectively in the second

quarter, when total earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole were up 4%.



Only two sectors are expected to have double-digit earnings growth - Finance (up

15.5%) and Construction (up 42.3%). Construction doesn't carry much weight in

the aggregate picture as it contributes less than 0.5% of total S&P 500

earnings, but the Finance strength is making the aggregate growth rate look a

lot better than it otherwise would be. Excluding Finance, total S&P 500 earnings

in the third quarter would be down 6.6%.
