OWEGO, N.Y., Oct. 29  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Team US101 has announced that 20

additional companies in three Mid-Atlantic states -- Delaware, New Jersey and

Pennsylvania -- will supply components for the American-built US101 medium-lift

helicopter. Team US101 is competing to provide the President of the United

States with a fleet of next-generation helicopters better known by the call sign

"Marine One."



"We're pleased to have these great aerospace companies supporting us in our bid

to win the Presidential Helicopter Replacement program," said Stephen D. Ramsey,

Lockheed Martin's US101 vice president and general manager.



Previously, Team US101 announced that five companies located near Johnstown, PA,

-- Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), DRS Laurel Technologies, DynaCom

Industries' Precision Parts Group, Martin Baker and MTS Technologies -- also are

supporting the US101 program.



The 20 additional Mid-Atlantic companies that will supply components for the

US101 helicopter are:



  ALCOA, Inc.                                     Pittsburgh, PA

   Avionic Instruments, Inc.                       Avenel, NJ

   BAE Systems                                     Wayne, NJ

   TYCO Electronics                                Harrisburg, PA

   W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc.                    Newark, DE







Team US101 is recognizing these suppliers at this time for their continuous

support during the very rigorous Presidential Helicopter Replacement (or VXX)

competition. Meanwhile, Team US101 continues to conduct risk reduction efforts

prior to the U.S. Navy's VXX award announcement, which is expected in December.



These 20 suppliers are among the more than 200 companies in 41 states chosen to

support Team US101 with key products and services necessary for the President's

new Marine One helicopter fleet. Other leading American companies on Team US101

include General Electric, ITT, Northrop Grumman and Palomar Products. During the

course of the helicopter fleet's operational service life, 90 percent of the

total life cycle costs will flow to Team US101's American suppliers, creating

and sustaining thousands of jobs nationwide while building these new Marine One

helicopters.



Team US101 is led by Lockheed Martin Systems Integration - Owego, which serves

as the prime contractor and systems integrator for the American-built US101

aircraft, an American variant of AgustaWestland's successful EH101 multimission

helicopter. The US101 team collectively brings unmatched rotorcraft expertise

and experience to this program: Lockheed Martin (prime contractor and systems

integration), AgustaWestland (aircraft design) and Bell Helicopter (aircraft

production), while General Electric will supply each helicopter with three,

2,500 shaft-horsepower CT7-8E engines.
