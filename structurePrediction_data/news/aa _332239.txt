LENGTH: 474 words



DATELINE: NEW YORK Jan. 15





NEW YORK, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire/ -- Paulson & Co. (Bloomberg: 573991Z US) Inc., a

New York-based investment management firm, today announced its retention of Dr.

Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as a member of its

advisory board. Dr. Greenspan will provide ongoing advice to Paulson's

investment management team by sharing his perspective on issues affecting the

financial markets. This will be an exclusive arrangement, insofar as Dr.

Greenspan will not enter into a similar consulting arrangement with any other

hedge fund while he is working with Paulson & Co. Inc.



Mr. John Paulson, president of the firm, said: "Few people, if any, in the world

have the breadth of experience with, and depth of understanding of, global

financial markets as Dr. Greenspan. Anticipating the direction of the economy,

and assessing the potential for and severity of a U.S. recession, are

fundamental in formulating current investment strategy. Dr. Greenspan's position

as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for 18 years, through multiple market

cycles, gives him a unique perspective from which to help our investment

management team make critical decisions."



Dr. Alan Greenspan said: "Paulson & Co. Inc. is one of the world's leading hedge

funds. I look forward to adding my perspectives on the global economy to that of

Mr. Paulson and his team."



  Financial terms were not disclosed.
