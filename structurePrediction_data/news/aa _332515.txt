FineGround Networks, Inc., the leader in web application optimization, announced

today it has opened a sales office in Hong Kong to expand business operations

into Asia Pacific to meet growing customer demand in the region. The Hong Kong

office will oversee sales operations throughout the Far East including China,

Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia. This expansion will accelerate the

company's ability to recruit regional reseller partners and implement support

arrangements for customers in the region.



"Asia-Pacific represents a growing and strategic marketplace for our

customer-centric solutions," said Nat Kausik, CEO of FineGround. "As companies

globalize business automation initiatives, FineGround offers a proven way to

help IT achieve their service levels. Our Hong Kong office is a visible

demonstration of our commitment to our valued customers and partners in the

region."



The FineGround Performance Suite(TM) is a server-side solution that provides

both optimization and monitoring capabilities for web-based applications. As

organizations deploy large-scale web applications for manufacturing, supply

chain, customer and partner management or simply employee communications, the

ability to gain the business benefits is often related directly to its

interactive performance. Enterprise customers like Korea Telecom, Whirlpool, and

Alcoa chose the FineGround solution to improve application throughput and ensure

adoption of core web-based business processes globally.



"FineGround's new Hong Kong office represents the next phase in our global

expansion strategy by providing industry leading application optimization

solutions throughout the Asia Pacific region," said Wayne Merrick, General

Manager of Asia for FineGround. "We recognize that many organizations with

mission critical Web applications experience great productivity loss due to poor

application performance at their branch offices. FineGround's Performance Suite

provides a cost-effective solution that can enable companies here in Asia to

increase their business efficiency rather than spend more on server

infrastructure or add more expensive bandwidth."
