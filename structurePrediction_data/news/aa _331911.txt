Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:



We Should Know by Easter



While the first quarter earnings season "officially" kicked off last week when

Alcoa (NYSE: AA) reported, it was a slow start. We have just 32 (6.4%) first

quarter reports in. It will pick up steam this week, when 111 members of the S&P

500 are due to report.



This week's reporters are a virtual who's who of American business, from Apple

(Nasdaq: AAPL) to Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and from Ford (NYSE: F) to McDonald's

(NYSE: MCD). While far too early to draw any conclusions, it looks like we are

off to a good start in the first quarter, with reported net income growth of

33.4%, actually up slightly from the 32.4% growth those same 32 firms reported

in the fourth quarter.



This Week Will Tell A Lot



By next week we should have a good idea of how the season as a whole will go.

The expectations for the remaining firms have been rising, but the hurdle is not

particularly high. The consensus is looking for a significant slowdown in growth

for the remaining firms, with total net income rising just 16.8%.



Financial firms setting aside much less than a year ago for bad debts were a big

part of the earnings story for the fourth quarter, and the story so far in the

first quarter. Excluding the Financials, total net income is up 16.5%, down from

growth of 24.2$ in the fourth quarter.



A big part of the deceleration in year-over-year growth has to do with a much

higher base, particularly in the Financials in the first quarter of 2010 than in

the fourth quarter of 2009. If the Financial sector is excluded, the expected

net income growth for the remaining firms is solid at 20.9%, actually up from

the 19.5% growth those same firms posted in the fourth quarter.



Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was healthy at 8.28%. Looking ahead to the

first quarter, though, those firms yet to report are expected to post

year-over-year revenue growth of 3.66%, down from 8.19% growth in the fourth

quarter. Financials are the key reason for the slowdown in revenue growth, if

they are excluded, reported revenue growth is expected to be 7.46%, while that

is down from the 8.22% growth posted last quarter, it is not nearly as dramatic.

Tougher year-over-year comparisons are a big part of the story.



Net Margin Expansion Slowing



Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is

slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Net margins for those

yet to report are expected to come in at 9.77% in the first quarter, up from

8.67% a year ago, and from 8.80% in the fourth quarter. However, excluding the

Financials, net margins are expected to rise to 9.25% from 8.22% a year ago, and

up from 8.78% in the fourth quarter.



Among the handful that have already reported for the first quarter, overall net

margins are 10.54%, up sharply from 8.40% a year ago and from 9.73% in the

fourth quarter. Strip away the Financials that have already reported and the

picture is different, rising to 8.30% from 7.82% a year ago and from the 7.88%

reported in the fourth quarter.



Look to Cyclicals



It looks like the more cyclical parts of the economy will be leading the growth

charge this quarter. The highest expected growth (among those yet to report)

comes from the Construction sector, where earnings are expected to be more than

double what they were last year, but in that case, so what, two times nothing is

still nothing. The Industrials, on the other hand, had decent earnings a year

ago, but are expected to report total net income that is 77.2% higher than in

the first quarter of 2010.



Unlike the construction firms, analysts have been raising the expectations for

the Industrials, for both 2011 and 2012, while they continue to slash the

estimates for the construction firms. The Transports are also expected to see

robust growth of 62.9% over last year. They are an interesting case in terms of

estimate revisions, with cuts for this year, but lots of increases for next

year. I suspect that what analysts are saying is that the underlying business is

very strong, but that they face a stiff headwind in the near term from higher

energy costs.



The Energy sector is also expected to have very strong growth, which is not a

shocker if you have filled up your tank lately. Total net income for the quarter

is expected to rise 45.2%, and the revisions are strong for both years.



The weakest sector by far is expected to be the Conglomerates, with earnings

falling 45.5%. Utilities are also expected to have a weak performance, with

total income down 9.0% from last year.



The Financials are expected to post positive growth, but only of 0.6%. They are

a bit of a wild card, in that how good a quarter they have will largely depend

on how much the banks can release reserves. Some will have major releases, and

others very little at all. The level of releases can be very hard to forecast at

any given bank. The quality of earnings growth coming from reserve releases is

very low.



On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall

net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.40% in 2009. They hit 8.59% in 2010 and

are expected to continue climbing to 9.50% in 2011 and 10.18% in 2012. The

pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials

are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.08% in 2009, but have

started a robust recovery and rose to 8.22% in 2010. They are expected to rise

to 8.82% in 2011 and 9.29% in 2012.



Expectations for 2011



The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for

2010 rising to $792.1 billion in 2010, up from $545.1 billion in 2009. In 2011,

the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $913.5 billion, or increases of

45.4% and 15.3%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net

income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.037 Trillion.



That will also put the "EPS" for the S&P 500 over the $100 "per share" level for

the first time at $108.72. That is up from $57.13 for 2009, $83.09 for 2010, and

$95.81 for 2011. In an environment where the 10 year T-note is yielding 3.50%, a

P/E of 15.8x based on 2010 and 13.7x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive.

The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.1x.



With far more estimates being raised than being cut (revisions ratio of 1.40),

one has to feel confident that the current expectations for 2011 will be hit,

and more likely exceeded. Analysts are raising their 2012 projections at an even

higher rate, with a revisions ratio of 1.86, or almost two increases for every

cut. While a lot can happen between now and the time the 2012 earnings are all

in, upward estimate momentum means that the current 2012 earnings are more

likely to be exceeded than for them to fall short.



The Economy & Politics



This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move

higher. The fact we are in the third year of the presidential cycle (almost

always the best of the four, and by a big margin). We have a Democrat in the

White House, which has historically meant good things for the stock market, with

an average annualized return over the last 50 years more than triple than when

the GOP holds the Oval Office.



While counting points on the S&P 500 is suspect over long periods of time, the

fact remains that on balance, every single point of increase in the S&P 500 over

the last 50 years has come with a Democrat in the White House. Those factors

should combine to make this a good year for the market.



Not All Smooth Sailing



That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. We managed to avoid a

government shutdown, but only at the cost of large spending cuts that will slow

the economy. Those should probably shave at least a half point off of the growth

we would have had in 2011, and probably result in hundreds of thousands fewer

jobs being created. Fortunately, the economy has some upward momentum, so the

cuts will simply slow the economy down, not throw it into reverse.



The lower growth will result in lower tax collections, so the impact on the

budget deficit will be much less than the amount advertised. Job creation

remains sluggish, but is starting to show signs of picking up. We created

230,000 jobs in the private sector in March, down from 240,000 in February, but

that is after a big upward revision to the February numbers. However, State and

Local governments laid off a total of 15,000 people for the month, on top of

46,000 pink slips the month before.



The idea that one can reduce unemployment by cutting jobs is positively

Orwellian, and it is hard to believe the advocates of doing so are taken

seriously. The household survey has been much more upbeat, showing growth of

291,000 jobs in March, on top of 250,000 gained the month before. The

unemployment rate fell to 8.8%, and it was as high as 9.8% as recently as

November.



The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as

well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the

first quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as

the reconstruction process gets under way. Many U.S. made products have parts

which are made in Japan and that is likely to disrupt production here. Still,

there appeared to be no impact on Industrial Production in March as

manufacturing output climbed 0.7%.



The turmoil in the Middle East is not going away, and that is likely to keep oil

prices both high and volatile. High oil prices will also act as a depressing

force on the economy. The Debt crisis in Europe is not going away with Portugal

now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by

raising rates.



On the plus side, the dollar has been weak, and that should improve the trade

deficit, and that will be a significant positive for the economy. The foreign

operations of U.S. companies will be much more profitable when the results are

measured in dollars. Inflation, other than in food and energy, is well

contained, up only 0.1% in March and 1.2% year over year. That should let the

Fed stay on Easy Street as far as monetary policy is concerned.
