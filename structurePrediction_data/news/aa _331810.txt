Continuing its mission to advance exemplary board leadership and the highest

standards of corporate governance inside the boardroom, the National Association

of Corporate Directors (NACD) today announced that 206 diverse companies became

NACD Full Board Members in 2011. NACD's Full Board Member companies can be

viewed at www.NACDonline.org/Members.



These companies - including McDonald's, CVS Caremark, Dell, General Motors and

Lowe's - supplement NACD's rapidly growing membership which includes more than

11,300 directors and 818 Full Board Member companies in aggregate. These members

range from Fortune 50 corporations to small- and mid-cap, public, private and

non-profit companies.



"As the premier resource for boards and directors, we are pleased to have these

companies' boards and their directors become NACD members. I look forward to

introducing our unique benefits, resources and information to these new members.

These practical tools are designed to help directors oversee the affairs of the

enterprise in a more effective and efficient manner," said Ken Daly, President

and CEO of NACD.



Corporate boards and directors join NACD to gain proprietary insights about

emerging issues and opportunities while demonstrating their commitment to the

corporate community - fellow directors, investors, advisors, regulators and

other stakeholders. Furthermore, NACD members sharpen their directorship skills

through continuous learning about leading and "next" practices through NACD's

peer-to-peer and multi-media programs.



"Engaged boards are better suited to serve as strategic assets for investors and

stakeholders, and NACD Full Board Members represent companies that have

committed themselves to advancing director professionalism and furthering

superior leadership in the boardroom. They should be applauded for their

dedication, and we are proud to count them among our membership at NACD," Daly

continued.



NACD Full Board Members receive superior value including custom-designed

benefits for the board's chairman, lead director and key committee chairs;

customized education and research designed specifically for the company; and the

ability to include executives in their membership.



NACD also unveiled a new concierge program for its Full Board Members. This

service is designed to enable members to access benefits, advisory services and

customized, in-boardroom programs and evaluations - opportunities that cover all

aspects of directors' corporate governance duties.
