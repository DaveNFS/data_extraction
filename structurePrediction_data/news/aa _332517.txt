JW Aluminum announced today that it has completed the purchase of the St. Louis,

Mo. and Russellville, Ark. foil plants from Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA). The purchase

was made as part of JW Aluminum's strategy to expand its business into lighter

gauge foil products, including flexible packaging.

    The two plants, to be known as JW Aluminum-St. Louis Operations and JW

Aluminum-Russellville Operations, add several new products to the company's

portfolio and provide a strong position in the light gauge foil market. JW

Aluminum's current plant in Mt. Holly will be renamed JW Aluminum - Mt. Holly

Operations.



As part of its expansion strategy, JW Aluminum also unveiled today a new

corporate logo and Web site to coincide with the completed acquisition. "As we

grow our market position, we feel it is appropriate to reflect our broader

identity in both a new logo and Web presence," said Jake Bigham, Vice President

of Sales. "We look forward to providing a new level of service and commitment to

the light-gauge market."
