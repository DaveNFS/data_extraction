Liu will lead Novelis' expansion plans in China in alignment with the company's

long term growth strategy for Asia. In his sales and marketing role, Liu will

drive the execution of major automotive growth opportunities for Novelis in

China and Korea. He joins Novelis from Alcoa China Rolled Products Group, where

he served as Vice President and Managing Director, Alcoa International (Asia)

Limited. In this role, Liu was responsible for commercial activities including

strategic planning, sales, marketing, customer technical service, sales

administration and trade compliance. Prior to Alcoa, Liu was President of

Lysaght China for BHP Steel China.



"Aluminum has been growing at a much faster pace than other comparable

materials," said Philip Martens, President and CEO of Novelis. "As global

urbanization and income continues to accelerate in Asia, and particularly China,

the flat rolled aluminum market is expected to double in size there by 2020. The

opening of our Shanghai office is an important step for Novelis to further

capitalize on this significant opportunity. With an expansion underway in Korea,

combined with our move into China, we can better serve rapidly growing consumer

demand in Asia for high-margin can, automotive and specialty products."



The company is currently investing approximately $400 million to expand its

aluminum rolling and recycling operations in South Korea in response to the

growing demand for its products in Asia and the Middle East. The rolling

expansion, which will include investments in both hot rolling and cold rolling

operations, will increase Novelis' aluminum sheet capacity in Asia to one

million metric tons annually. Novelis operates an Asian regional head office in

Seoul, South Korea, leading operations and sales for its three manufacturing

facilities in South Korea and Malaysia.
