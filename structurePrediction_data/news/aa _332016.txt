WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The following is a statement from

the U.S. Climate Action Partnership regarding the release today of a legislative

framework by Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Joe

Lieberman (I-CT):



Today's announcement by Sens. Kerry, Graham and Lieberman of a framework for

enacting energy and climate legislation is an important contribution to moving

legislation forward. These Senators -- along with their colleagues who are

working hard on this important issue -- are to be commended for their

tri-partisan leadership and vision.



They understand that properly designed legislation can spur investments in

low-carbon energy technologies that will jumpstart our economy, enhance our

energy security, protect American jobs and create new ones.



USCAP, which in January issued the Blueprint for Legislative Action, the

Partnership's consensus recommendations on climate legislation, welcomes Sens.

Kerry, Graham and Lieberman's continued engagement in this process and we look

forward to working productively with them and other Senators in the weeks ahead.



United States Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) is a group of businesses and

leading environmental organizations that have come together to call on the

federal government to quickly enact strong national legislation to require

significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.
