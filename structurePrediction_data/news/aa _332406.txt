- General Motors Given Lowest Rating



According to a poll held by research office Marketadvices.com, General Electric,

Microsoft and Citigroup stocks are currently generating the most confidence

among analysts. The poll also shows that investors would do well to stay away

from General Motors, Merck & Co and Alcoa.



Buy recommendations



Analysts see the General Electric stock in particular as a high flyer.

Organisations including Prudential, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America recently

issued a buy recommendation for this stock. A total of 25 analysts are now

recommending that investors buy General Electric. It also turns out that

Microsoft has recently found favor with analysts, with buy recommendations from

renowned institutions like Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Piper Jaffray in

November. Finally, Citigroup is doing well among analysts too with 20 buy

recommendations from big names including Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch.



Sell recommendations



Bear Stearns issued a sell recommendation for General Motors on 6 October. The

stock is not rated by ABN AMRO or Goldman Sachs at present either. As well as

General Motors, various institutions are also issuing the recommendation "sell"

for Alcoa and Merck & Co.



International perspective



A look at the DAX shows that Allianz is very highly rated by the analysts, with

29 buy recommendations and only two recommendations to hold. Not a single

analyst ventures to put out a sell recommendation for the stock.



The French Arcelor and the Dutch ING Group are also proving to be popular.
