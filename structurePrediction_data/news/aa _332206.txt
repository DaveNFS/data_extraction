Procedural Shortcoming Triggers Additional Public Comment Period for the Yadkin

Project's Water Quality Certificate



LENGTH: 270 words



DATELINE: BADIN, N.C. April 17





BADIN, N.C., April 17 /PRNewswire/ -- Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI) has

learned that a required legal notice regarding its application for a water

quality certificate for the Yadkin Hydroelectric Project was not published.

Alcoa had provided the information necessary for the publication of the notice,

and the lack of publication was apparently an inadvertent oversight.



To remedy this failure to publish the notice, the NC Division of Water Quality

posted a legal notice in the Stanly News & Press on April 17, 2008 seeking

public comment on APGI's application for a water quality certificate for the

Yadkin Project. State officials will accept public comment for the next 15 days,

through May 2, 2008.



The NC Division of Water Quality originally issued a water quality certificate

to APGI on November 17, 2007, after six months of review and public comment. The

Division now plans to revoke it and reissue a certificate for the Yadkin Project

after the public comment period has closed and after it has considered all

information submitted in response to the public notice.



"We don't expect this technicality to have an impact on the relicensing

process," said Gene Ellis, APGI licensing and property manager. "We fully

anticipate the state will promptly reissue the water quality certificate once

this additional public comment period has passed."
