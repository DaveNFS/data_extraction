MARKET OVERVIEW



The U.S. Dollar Index added 0.06 points in trading yesterday ahead of this

afternoon's Fed announcement.  Confidence is running high that the Federal

Reserve will once again increase interest rates by 25 basis points at its

meeting today.  Another increase should prove to be a boon for the dollar, as

higher interest rates makes investing in dollar-denominated issues more

attractive.  In early trading, the dollar is slightly lower against the euro.



The April contract on sweet crude oil edged 32 cents per barrel higher on

Friday.  News was mixed in the oil pits on Monday, as threats of an oil-worker

strike in Nigeria (a key crude producing member of OPEC) counterbalanced another

prospective output hike from OPEC.  Nigerian workers reportedly intend to strike

for three days beginning April 11 in protest of working conditions. Saudi

Arabia's oil minister -- Ali al-Naimi, stated that his country wants to relieve

concerns regarding global oil supplies and has 1.5 million barrels of spare

capacity that it could use to stem rising prices.  So far this morning, the May

crude contract is down eight cents at $57.38.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



Just one day before the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for

the seventh straight time since June 2004 (to 2.75%), the stock market spent

Monday firmly in the red. This is interesting, considering that monetary policy

has become carefully choreographed, with a lack of suspense accompanying each

decision. In fact, futures contracts indicate the bankers will raise interest

rates by 0.25% in May, June and August. Today and Wednesday will also see the US

Labor Department release the latest set of inflation data. The figures are

projected to show a 0.1% rise in the February Producer Price Index, with overall

consumer prices climbing 0.3% last month, and a 0.2% increase in the "core" rate

(which excludes heavily fluctuating items like energy and food). Elsewhere,

there were interesting results from the latest survey of 172 members of the

National Association for Business Economics. According to the results, what was

the top economic fear among American companies -- that being the persistent

threat of another terrorist attack -- has now waned and been displaced by the

budget deficit. Over one- quarter of respondents said America's enormous deficit

now poses the greatest risk to the American economy. That was up 4% from the

previous survey, taken in August 2004. Those citing the current account deficit

as the most serious economic risk tripled from just 5% in August to 15% today.

However, just 17% said the government is getting fiscal policy correct, but over

75% believe spending and taxation is too stimulative. And while a similar number

expressed grave concerns about the Social Security woes, the chances of the

government pushing through major reforms within the next couple of years is a

relatively low 36%. Somewhat surprisingly, the percentage of companies who put

terrorism at the top of their list of economic concerns dropped from 40% to 24%.

What isn't a surprise, however, is the rise in the proportion of people citing

energy as a top worry -- from 6% in August to 11% now.
