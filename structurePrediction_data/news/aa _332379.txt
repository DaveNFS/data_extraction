Survey Shows Alarming Drop in CEO Transparency Since Enron Bankruptcy



LENGTH: 441 words



DATELINE: NEW YORK May 2





NEW YORK, May 2  /PRNewswire/ -- CEO transparency in shareholder letters, a key

indicator of CEO integrity, has substantially declined since the Enron

bankruptcy and the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, according to an annual

survey of investor communications.  The 2005 Rittenhouse Candor Rankings(SM)

survey found an increasing number of companies use more jargon, spin more

information and make more confusing statements in shareholder letters than

before the exposure of widespread corporate fraud in 2002.



L.J. Rittenhouse, President of andBEYOND Communications said, "The passage of

Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in 2002 was intended to promote clear and transparent

disclosure, but only 24 percent of the companies in our 2005 survey were awarded

top marks in candor down from 57 percent in the 2002 survey.  While many

executives are certifying their results to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, they are

also publishing virtually unintelligible shareholder letters.  If they cannot

candidly articulate their goals and results, then how can they credibly walk

their talk?"



The Rittenhouse Candor Rankings(SM) survey, which includes a cross-section of

Fortune 500 companies, also confirmed the continuation of a strong positive link

between candor and stock price performance.  In each of the past four years, the

25 top-ranked companies in candid disclosure have outperformed the 25

bottom-ranked companies.



"The 2005 survey shows an increase in the use of Orwellian double speak which

contradicts and distorts reality," says Rittenhouse.  Examples include CSX's

claim that the Clear Skies legislation will promote "the use of clean, efficient

fuel sources like coal," and BNSF's goal to "further improve revenue adequacy."



Among the 2005 survey's top ten companies excelling in candor, six are

service-based and four are manufacturing companies.  Of these, Wells Fargo,

Continental Airlines and Walgreens have been ranked among the top ten in candor

for four consecutive years.  Xerox showed the greatest improvement from 2002 to

2005, while IBM failed to place in the top ten for the first time since 2002.
