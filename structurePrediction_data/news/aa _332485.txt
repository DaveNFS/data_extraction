MARKET OVERVIEW



Overseas markets have failed to put on anything resembling a happy face this

morning, as none of the 15 markets that we track are positive. The Nikkei is

faring the best, simply because there was no trade overnight. The cumulative

average return on the active bourses stands at a minus 0.506 percent. About the

only piece of major news out of the region was the lowered earnings guidance by

London based Unilever. In light of this news, Colgate came out with a bit of

disturbing news on its third and fourth quarter numbers...I guess with Alcoa

earnings some two week away, marking the start of the upcoming earnings season,

we could well be in that period of "guidance adjustments." These little tidbits

of information do not appear on the normally published economic calendars; so we

lovingly refer to them as surprises.



Not much on the agenda today, but traders will most certainly be jockeying for

position ahead of tomorrow's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) post meeting

statements. At 1:00 p.m. this afternoon the sentiment based September National

Association of Home Builders (NAHB) Housing Market Index will be released. The

prior reading stood at a healthy 71. Today's earnings should prove a bit

interesting, highlighting Adobe Systems, homebuilders KB Homes and Lennar, as

well as Nike and PalmOne. We get off to a bit of a rocky start this morning as

the price of a barrel of crude shot up over $46.00 per barrel earlier in the

session. We'll have to see how this impact pans out as the day progresses.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



The market has hit a critical juncture. Speculation is rife that Alan Greenspan

and the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again tomorrow. The low

inflation number (0.1% on the CPI) gives the Chairman some wiggle room.

Obviously, the market would jump if he didn't cut. But since the issue revolves

around just a quarter of a point, it's highly likely the Fed will stick to its

plan and tighten a fraction. In just two weeks' time, the calendar will turn to

October -- a notoriously volatile time for the markets. On October 19, 1987 the

stock market fell 508 points. On October 29, 1929 it lost 40% of its value.

However, this October bodes well. The Volatility Index has dropped to 14, which

is less than a point off its all time low -- a bullish sign. The put/call ratio

is also on the lower side at 0.75, which is bullish too. At the 247Profits

Group's Value Edge investment service, chief trader William Colburn also remains

bullish on his flagship defense sector play, DHB Industries. Colburn cites three

reasons: "One: I'm bullish on defense stocks, period. Two: DHB is starting to

make a comeback. Three: The stock is still undervalued." Colburn is currently

sitting on a 29% gain, with the stock still full of potential.
