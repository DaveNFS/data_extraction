DATELINE: LAS VEGAS Feb. 16





California Coach Builders will release to the press and to the limousine

industry its new F-650 270" CrewZer at the Limousine and Chauffer Transportation

Show being held February 22 through 24, 2004 at the Mandalay Bay Convention

Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.



The press is invited to a Champagne reception and to preview the new vehicle at

a private reception being held Saturday, February 21, 2004, 9 pm at Bayside Hall

D prior to the unveiling to the industry on the exhibit floor.



The new super stretch Limousine is the first of its kind. Built with an F-650

truck body, the vehicle's chassis is not cut for stretching. Stretched 270",

this luxury stretch truck is going to be the show stopper at the Limousine Show

taking place at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada from February 22 to 24,

2004. With all of the bells and whistles, the Super CrewZer is a party on

wheels. Equipped with a 42" plasma Display and large flat screen televisions,

play stations, DVD players, Light shows and smoke machines, the Super CrewZer is

a destination in its own right for partiers.



California Coach Owner, Gary Bauer, knows this market. In addition to owning

California Coach, he also owns Bauer Transportation, which operates over 75

livery vehicles in the San Francisco Bay area. "We need to anticipate and

produce quality, safe and innovative vehicles that our consumers want," says

Bauer, who has brought his innovative designs to stretch Hummers, Excursions,

Escalades, Executive Excursions and Suburbans. "When teens see the rock stars on

MTV getting out of stretched Hummers and SUVs, they want to do the same," says

Bauer.



Safety is an issue with super stretch vehicles. Bauer is certain it won't be

with the Super CrewZer. "Unlike like other limousines that have their chassis

cut in order for them to be stretched, the Super CrewZer's chassis is not cut.

It is a NHTSA compliant truck with a Caterpillar 210 HP engine with factory

oversized front and rear disc breaks with ABS. The new F-650 Super stretch

employees a breaking system that is able to stop over two times the payload of

the loaded capacity," explains Bauer.
