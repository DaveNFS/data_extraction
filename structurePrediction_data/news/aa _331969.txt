DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Germany, Sept. 30





FRANKFURT, Germany, Sept. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- The Almatis Group today announced

that its plan of reorganization (the "Plan"), which was confirmed by the United

States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on September 20,

2010, became effective today allowing Almatis to complete its financial

restructuring and emerge from Chapter 11.



"Today's successful emergence from Chapter 11 after just five months allows us

to turn our full attention to the growth and development of business again,"

stated Remco de Jong, CEO of Almatis. "As we have said before, we are emerging

from Chapter 11 as a stronger company with significantly reduced debt and a

strongly operating business. With this stronger financial footing and the

support of DIC, who continues to be our majority shareholder, we are able to

invest and pursue growth opportunities for the business."



Remco de Jong added: "We would also like to thank our customers, suppliers,

business partners, lenders and employees for their support throughout this

process. The commitment of our stakeholders was instrumental in effectuating the

necessary financial restructuring."



Pursuant to the Plan, the existing senior debt was repaid in full. In addition,

the junior lenders to Almatis will receive new PIK Notes and a 40% equity stake

in the Almatis Group in exchange for their old claims. In exchange for a new

$100 million equity investment, DIC will retain a 60% equity stake in the

Almatis Group. Financing for the distributions under the Plan was provided from

the new DIC equity investment and from approximately $565 million in new debt

underwritten by GSO Capital Partners, Sankaty Credit Opportunities IV, and

GoldenTree Asset Management. An additional $50 million revolving credit facility

is provided by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch International and several units of

JP Morgan Chase. As a result of the occurrence of the effective date of the

Plan, Almatis will also pay in full all outstanding prepetition claims of trade

vendors expeditiously.
