 Nominations are now being accepted for the 2012 Silver Crescent Awards for

achievement and contribution by South Carolina's leading manufacturers.



The Silver Crescent Award is the most prestigious award that a South Carolina

manufacturer can receive. Presented annually by the Silver Crescent Foundation,

its partners and the statewide manufacturing Community, the Award recognizes

excellence in manufacturing operations in each of 7 Crescents of Excellence.

Awards are made to Small (<200 employees), Medium (200-499 employees) and Large

(>500 employees) manufacturers.



The exclusive annual recognition program honors manufacturing organizations from

across the state for citizenship, employee engagement, customer satisfaction,

environmental stewardship, innovation, financial performance and commitment to

longevity in South Carolina. Past recipients include such notables as Robert

Bosch, Bridgestone-Firestone, BorgWarner, Alcoa, Sonoco and GE Energy.



To be eligible, companies must submit a simple Intent to Apply form by November

15, 2012. The Intent form will be acknowledged by the Silver Crescent Foundation

and a nomination package sent to each candidate company. Forms and guidelines

are also available online at http://www.SaluteToManufacturing.org . All

nominations must be submitted by December 31, 2012.  Nominations may be

submitted by companies directly or by third parties, and will be evaluated and

ranked by a review panel from the Silver Crescent Foundation and industry

leaders.



Top companies will be honored on March 21, 2013 at the Salute To Manufacturing

Awards Luncheon at the TD Convention Center in Greenville, South Carolina.

Awards will be presented in the Small, Midsized and Large Manufacturer

Categories. A private best-practices forum will precede the luncheon.



The 2012 Silver Crescent Awards are co-sponsored by CPM Federal Credit Union,

and by SC Biz News, LLC. Sponsorship opportunities are now available with

details posted online.



"We encourage eligible manufacturers, or supplier-partners to manufacturers, to

said program director Sharon Halsey. "Nominees benefit from expanded awareness

of their organization, networking with top manufacturing executives, positive

employee morale and regional/national recognition. It's a great opportunity for

Palmetto State manufacturers."
