NEW YORK, Feb. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Reportlinker.com announces that a new market

research report is available in its catalogue:



Aluminum Die Castings - Global Market Trends

s.html



The rising strength of aluminum die-castings in recent years is mostly traceable

to automotive industry, which has experienced considerable growth in sales of

cars and light-duty trucks. These motor vehicles witnessed a significant

increase in use of components such as die-castings made of aluminum. An emerging

trend in die-castings is the increasing co-operation between end-users and

die-casters. Increasing competition, pricing pressures, and faster lead times

are necessitating these co-operations. Additionally larger die-casters are also

being given the role of assembling small parts, and finishing jobs such as

painting or plating of parts.



These and other market data and trends are presented in "Aluminum Die-Castings:

Global Market Trends" by BizAcumen, Inc. Our reports are designed to be most

comprehensive in geographic coverage and vertical market analyses.
