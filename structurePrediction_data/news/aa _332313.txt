PORTLAND, Maine, Feb. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Energy East Corporation

(NYSE:EAS) has joined an unprecedented group of more than 85 companies and

organizations from around the world to endorse The Path to Climate

Sustainability: A Joint Statement by the Global Roundtable on Climate Change, a

bold framework for protecting the environment while creating the sustainable

energy systems necessary for achieving economic growth.



"With energy consumption continuing to increase, it is incumbent on our industry

to partner with others to identify and implement aggressive energy efficiency

measures and work toward reducing emissions of greenhouse gases," said Wes von

Schack, Chairman and CEO of Energy East. "At our initiative, we are already

making considerable progress by adding to our capacity to generate

environmentally-friendly hydroelectricity, planning to implement a system of

smart meters that will enable us to work with our customers to reduce demand --

particularly during on-peak times -- and improving the efficiency of our energy

distribution system."



The joint statement calls on governments to set scientifically-informed targets

for greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The statement also urges

governments to place a price on carbon emissions and to set forth policies aimed

at addressing energy efficiency and de-carbonization in all sectors. Calling

climate change "an urgent problem," the statement lays out a proactive framework

for global action to mitigate risks and impacts while also meeting the global

need for energy, economic growth and sustainable development. It outlines

cost-effective technologies that exist today and others that could be developed

and deployed to improve energy efficiency and help reduce CO2 emissions and

other greenhouse gases in major sectors of the global economy.



The ability of so many key stakeholders with such diverse views to agree upon

the joint statement demonstrates the possibility of fostering a global consensus

on a positive, proactive approach to meeting the challenge of global climate

change. In addition to Energy East, the signatories include Air France, Alcoa,

Allianz, Bayer, China Renewable Energy Industry Association, Citigroup,

Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, Eni, Eskom, Florida Power & Light

Group, General Electric, Iberdrola, ING, Interface, Munich Re, NRG Energy,

Patagonia, Ricoh, Rolls Royce, Stora Enso North America, Suntech Power,

Vattenfall, Volvo, World Council of Churches, World Petroleum Council and many

others.



Since 2004, the diverse members of the Global Roundtable on Climate Change, an

initiative of The Earth Institute at Columbia University, has convened more than

100 high-level stakeholders and experts twice a year to explore areas of

potential consensus regarding core scientific, technological, and economic

issues critical to shaping public policies on climate change. The joint

statement is an outcome of these dialogues, and was built on careful discussion

over the past three years.



Individuals can take a step toward combating climate change by adding their name

to a growing global call for action at  www.NextGenerationEarth.org . The Web

site, launched on February 19, gives people an opportunity to have their voices

heard on issues of global well being and environmental sustainability. The

climate principles on the Web site are based on elements of the joint statement.
