NEW YORK, Nov. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Reportlinker.com announces that a new market

research report is available in its catalogue:



Aluminum - A Worldwide Market Review



http://www.reportlinker.com/p0164491/Aluminum---A-Worldwide-Market-Review.html



Aluminum is a highly power-intensive industry. Extensive applications in end-use

sectors such as electric transmission, automotive, packaging, construction and

consumer durable sectors fuel market growth. Power shortage and transportation

are the key bottlenecks that are currently undermining the profitability of the

global aluminum industry. In addition, increasing prices of raw material and

energy are pressurizing margins and are creating problems in production, cost

reduction, and operation of the aluminum industry.



These and other market data and trends are presented in "Aluminum: A Worldwide

Market Review" by BizAcumen, Inc. Our reports are designed to be most

comprehensive in geographic coverage and vertical market analyses.
