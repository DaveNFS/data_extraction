Do you consider P/E ratios when looking at a stock? Most people do. But

according to Christopher Michaels, "P/E ratios are one of the least important

parameters of a stock's price performance." Mr. Michaels, Publisher of

IntelligentValue Newsletter, says that P/E Ratio was beaten by seven other

criteria in an extensive five-year study that found seven stronger criteria with

the top one producing a return of 105% per year. Read more about the study at
