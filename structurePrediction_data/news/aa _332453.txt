MARKET OVERVIEW



Trading overseas is going strong this morning, with 12 of the 15 markets that we

follow in positive territory.  The cumulative average return on the group

currently stands at a 0.186-percent gain as of 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. European

stocks were mixed Thursday ahead of interest rate policy meetings in both the

euro zone and the U.K.  Monetary policy makers at both the European Central Bank

and the Bank of England are poised to leave interest rates unchanged amid weak

economic growth in the euro zone and slower consumer spending in the U.K.

Currently, interest rates stand at 4.75 percent in the U.K. and at two percent

in the euro zone.



Traders will finally enjoy a taste of economic news this morning with the

release of weekly initial jobless claims.  According to the Dow Jones Newswire,

the Street is expecting claims to drop by 20,000 to 330,000.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



Having now been shunned for the third time, will Qwest finally give up on its

battle with Verizon to acquire MCI? Latest development in the two-month old

buyout saga saw MCI reject Qwest's renewed US$9.1 billion takeover bid, having

asked it to tender US$9.9 billion (US$30 per share). That would seem to leave

Verizon Communications firmly in pole position - despite the fact that its bid

is a significantly lower US$7.6 billion (US$23.50 per share). However, Qwest has

no interest in retiring from the race yet. Although MCI has said it's open to

further negotiations, Qwest's next move may come in the form of a hostile bid

that bypasses MCI executives and goes directly to MCI shareholders instead,

since many believe Qwest's offer represents fairer value. That might be the case

in the short-term. But longer-term, the odds unquestionably favor Verizon.

Already the largest telecommunications company in America, its market cap of

US$98.7 billion easily beats Qwest's US$6.7 billion. It has US$4.5 billion in

cash, versus Qwest's US$1.7 billion. And it's generating US$21.2 billion in cash

from operations against Qwest's comparatively paltry US$1.8 billion. That's no

surprise, since Verizon sales hit US$71 billion last year, versus Qwest's

US$13.8 billion. In addition, MCI says many of its customers are wary of a deal

with Qwest. It remains to be seen what twist this buyout saga will take next,

but the cards still appear stacked in Verizon's favor, as they have been from

the start.
