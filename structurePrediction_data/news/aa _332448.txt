WASHINGTON, April 27  /PRNewswire/ -- When the Airbus A380 took to the skies

above Toulouse, France this morning, thousands of American workers at hundreds

of airplane manufacturing and systems companies across the United States swelled

with pride at the first flight.



From California to Florida, U.S. workers in more than 30 states have produced

A380 parts and systems ranging from the smallest (fasteners by Textron Fastening

Systems in Santa Ana, Calif.) to some of the largest (the main landing gear by

Goodrich).



"The United States is the largest single supplier country to Airbus, making

Airbus the largest export customer for the U.S. aerospace industry," says Allan

McArtor, Chairman-Airbus North America Holdings. "A large part of this business

is dedicated to the A380, so as the A380 program grows and prospers, so will the

economies where these suppliers are based, and the U.S. industrial and

manufacturing bases."



The A380 lifted off at approximately 4:30 EDT this morning, and returned at

approximately 8:30 a.m. EDT. This flight test is the latest milestone in the

decade-long development of the "Flagship of the 21st Century."  Designed in

close collaboration with major airlines, airports and airworthiness authorities

around the world, the 555-seat, double-deck A380 will provide passengers on

major long-haul routes with a new way of flying, offering unrivalled comfort,

economy and technology.



Even before the first flight today, Airbus had received orders and commitments

for 154 A380s from 15 customers, including from Memphis, Tenn.- based FedEx and

Atlanta-based UPS.
