MARKET OVERVIEW



It was a slow day yesterday for the currencies markets as traders looked forward

to this morning's employment report before making any moves. The dollar did get

a shot in the arm early in the morning as the weekly initial jobless claims for

last week fell 37,000 to 335,000 but trended lower most of the afternoon.  It

all really boils down to the employment report which is due for release at 8:30

a.m. this morning. The consensus is for an increase of 150,000 jobs and an

unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.



The price of oil continues to dampen any upward move in the market. November

Crude rose 65 cents yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange to once again

close at a new all-time high.  Continued concerns over Wednesday's weaker than

expected weekly inventories had traders out in force buying with strong

conviction.  Not helping matters any was Nigeria's oil workers threatening to go

on strike next week.  The African country is the seventh largest oil producer in

the world as it exports 2.5 million barrels a day.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



In the hours leading up to the second of three presidential debates between

President Bush and John Kerry, the Labor Department will release its report on

September employment data.  While the numbers could make the case for Kerry, who

believes that Americans have suffered from poor economic conditions, the White

House hopes the report will ease the fact that Bush could be the first president

since Herbert Hoover with no net job creation. You see, even though payrolls

have shown growth of 1.7 million over the last 12 months, the economy is down by

a net 913,000 jobs since Bush was sworn into office.  It doesn't help that U.S.

employers announced 107,863 job cuts in September, a 45.4% gain from August.

That was the worst month for job cuts since January's job loss of 117,556.  Only

16,166 jobs were added, which was down from the 132,105 in August.  However,

even if Friday's numbers are poor, revised employment data from March 2003 to

March 2004 that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report, could give Bush one

last leg to stand on.  The data, accompanying the payroll data, could be revised

north by as much as 288,000 to 384,000 jobs, according to reports that could

have a wide margin of error one way or the other.  Wall Street is just hoping

that news that jobless claims dipped by 37,000 to 335,000 from a revised 372,000

will foretell exceptional September employment data leading up to tonight's

second presidential debate. It will make for an interesting debate.
