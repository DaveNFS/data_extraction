AIA Criticizes President's Remarks on Business Aviation



LENGTH: 205 words



DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., June 29, 2011





Statement by Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO Marion C. Blakey



We're disturbed by President Obama's remarks on business aviation today. It

seems odd that he would undermine the aviation industry one day after visiting

Alcoa's factory and praising the workers who make parts and materials that are

critical to producing business jets. General aviation plays an important role in

our economy and took a substantial hit in the recent recession. We feel that

disparaging comments from the president regarding business jet users are not

conducive to promoting jobs, investment and economic growth.
