About Douglas R. Conant



Douglas R. Conant was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of

Campbell Soup Company in January of 2001. He also was elected a Director of the

company at that time. Conant is Campbell's 11th leader in the company's nearly

140-year history.



Campbell is a global manufacturer and marketer of high quality foods and simple

meals -- including soup -- and baked snacks, vegetable-based beverages, and

Conant joined Campbell with 25 years of extensive food industry experience from

three of the world's leading food companies: General Mills, Inc., Kraft Foods,

and Nabisco.



Under Conant's leadership, Campbell has reversed a decline in market value and

employee engagement. The company has made significant investments to improve

product quality and packaging, to strengthen the effectiveness of its marketing

programs, and to develop a robust innovation pipeline. Campbell also has

improved its financial profile, enhanced its relationships with its customers,

and consistently improved its employee engagement through investments in its

organization.



Today, Campbell is delivering total shareowner returns in the top tier of the

global food industry and displaying ever-improving employee engagement levels.

As a result, the company is well on its way to achieving its mission of building

the world's most extraordinary food company by nourishing people's lives

everywhere, every day.



A native of Chicago, Conant earned his bachelor of arts degree from Northwestern

University and his master's degree in business administration from the J.L.
