NEW HOLLAND, Pa., July 21  /PRNewswire/ -- On behalf of Pennsylvania Gov. Edward

G. Rendell, Department of Labor & Industry Secretary Stephen M. Schmerin today

awarded a $325,000 Manufacturing Sector Incumbent Worker Training Grant to a

supervisory training consortium of metal manufacturers in Southcentral

Pennsylvania.  The Lancaster Workforce Investment Board will manage the grant.

The secretary's visit to the CNH manufacturing plant in New Holland provided an

opportunity to highlight the work of the consortium.



"It is important that our manufacturing workers have training available to them

to expand their skills and increase their opportunities to move into supervisory

positions," Schmerin said.  "The work of this consortium will not only ensure

this type of training exists, but will also go a long way in helping

Pennsylvania continue to be an industrial leader in the nation."



The $325,000 grant was awarded to the Lancaster and Southcentral Workforce

Investment Boards and MANTEC-IRC.  The consortium consists of 10 manufacturers

from Lancaster and York counties, including Alcoa Mill Products, Burnham

Holdings, CNH, Electron Energy, Hanover Lantern, Harley-Davidson, KBA North

America, New Standard, Nexans and Ross Technology.



The group will use the funds to enhance leadership, continue improvement

practices, and for the cost control of safety, legal and budget competencies of

more than 300 current and prospective supervisors enrolled in the program. The

goal of the consortium is to build a pipeline of non-supervisory personnel who

can eventually move into supervisory positions, thereby strengthening the

competitive advantage of the Southcentral Pennsylvania region as a metal and

metal fabricating industry stronghold.



Through Gov. Rendell's Job Ready PA initiatives, which recently during the

2005-2006 commonwealth budget cycle, $15 million in new state funding will be

targeted to expand skills training for adult workers in other high priority

occupations across the state.  Grant application guidelines are available online
