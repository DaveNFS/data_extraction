TransDigm Group Reports Fiscal 2011 Second Quarter Results



LENGTH: 4370 words



DATELINE: CLEVELAND, May 10, 2011





TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG), a leading global designer, producer

and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, today reported results

for the second quarter ended April 2, 2011.



Highlights for the second quarter:



Net sales of $311.3 million, up 51.1% from $206.1 million;EBITDA As Defined of

$146.7 million, up 47.1% from $99.8 million;Net income of $55.8 million, up

46.7% from $38.0 million;Earnings per share of $1.05, up 45.8% from $0.72;

Adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, up 24.4% from $0.78; andUpward revision in

fiscal 2011 earnings outlook



As previously announced, on March 9, 2011, TransDigm completed the sale of its

fastener businesses to Alcoa Inc. for approximately $240 million in cash. These

businesses were acquired as part of the McKechnie Aerospace acquisition in

December 2010. Accordingly, the results of the fastener businesses are presented

as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from continuing

operations. The divestiture created a book gain on sale of $21.0 million, net of

tax. This gain on sale and the loss from discontinued operations of $2.2

million, net of tax, are excluded from the Company's EBITDA As Defined, adjusted

net income and adjusted earnings per share.



Net sales for the quarter, which excludes $10.3 million of net sales from

discontinued operations, rose 51.1% to $311.3 million from $206.1 million in the

comparable quarter a year ago. Organic net sales growth was approximately 11.7%

driven by improvement in both commercial aftermarket and OEM markets. The

acquisitions of Semco Instruments, McKechnie Aerospace and Talley Actuation

accounted for the balance of the sales increase.



Net income for the quarter increased 46.7% to $55.8 million, or $1.05 per share

which includes $19.1 million, or $0.36 per share, from discontinued operations.

Income from continuing operations of $36.7 million, or $0.69 per share,

decreased slightly from $38.0 million, or $0.72 per share, in the prior year.

Despite the higher sales the quarter was negatively impacted by

acquisition-related expenses associated with the McKechnie Aerospace and Talley

Actuation acquisitions of $12.6 million, net of tax, or $0.24 per share, and

higher interest expense related to the refinancing of the Company's debt

structure in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Net income in the comparable

quarter a year ago included acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, net of

tax, or $0.04 per share.



Adjusted net income for the quarter rose 25.5% to $51.7 million, or $0.97 per

share, from $41.2 million, or $0.78 per share, in the comparable quarter a year

ago.



EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the results of discontinued operations,

increased 34.5% to $128.3 million from $95.4 million for the comparable quarter

a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the period, increased 47.1% to $146.7 million

compared with $99.8 million in the quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a

percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.1%.



"We are pleased with our operating results for both the second quarter and

year-to-date periods," stated W. Nicholas Howley, TransDigm Group's Chairman and

Chief Executive Officer. "The commercial aerospace market continues to improve,

as organic sales rose sequentially and were up significantly versus the prior

year. Due to the combination of improving commercial aftermarket demand and our

ongoing value-based operating strategies, EBITDA As Defined margin for the first

half remained strong at 47.0% despite acquisition dilution of approximately 3

margin points. This performance again reflects our strict focus on both the

details of value creation and a well-defined acquisition strategy through all

phases of the market cycle.



"In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we completed the divestiture of the

fastener businesses for approximately $240 million and re-priced our $1.55

billion of bank debt, and shortly after quarter-end we sold the distribution

business for approximately $30 million," continued Mr. Howley. "We ended the

quarter with over $505 million in cash and almost $240 million of capacity on

our revolving credit facility. This strong liquidity position and additional

capacity under our credit agreement provides us with adequate financial

flexibility to support growth, continue to pursue acquisition opportunities

and/or optimize our capital structure."



Year-to-Date Results



Net sales, which excludes discontinued operations, for the 26-week period ended

April 2, 2011 rose 40.4% to $548.2 million from $390.4 million in the comparable

period last year. This increase is primarily due to recent acquisitions, with

organic sales up 11.1%.



Net income for the 26-week period decreased 29.6% to $48.5 million, or $0.86 per

share, which includes $18.8 million, net of tax, or $0.36 per share, from

discontinued operations. Income from continuing operations decreased 56.8% to

$29.7 million, or $0.50 per share, reflecting one-time costs attributable to the

capital structure refinancing of $46.0 million, net of tax, or $0.86 per share,

and the acquisition-related expenses associated with the McKechnie Aerospace and

Talley Actuation transactions of $18.0 million, net of tax, or $0.34 per share.

In addition, earnings per share in the first quarter were reduced by $0.05 per

share due to dividend equivalent payments. Net income in the comparable period a

year ago of $68.8 million, or $0.73 per share, included acquisition-related

expenses of $5.9 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per share. In addition, earnings

per share were reduced by $0.57 per share due to dividend equivalent payments.



Adjusted net income for the 26-week period rose 25.3% to $96.2 million, or $1.80

per share, from $76.8 million, or $1.45 per share, in the comparable period a

year ago.



EBITDA (which excludes discontinued operations) for the 26-week period decreased

11.5% to $158.9 million from $179.5 million in the comparable period a year ago.

EBITDA As Defined for the period, increased 35.5% to $257.7 million compared

with $190.1 million in the comparable period a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a

percentage of net sales for the period was 47.0%.



Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA,

EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash

provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a

reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the

periods discussed in this press release.



Earnings per share is calculated under the "two-class method." The application

of the two-class method as compared to the treasury stock method requires the

inclusion of approximately two million additional shares outstanding for the

quarter, which results in dilution of earnings per share by approximately 3-4%

on a fully diluted basis.



Fiscal 2011 Outlook



Mr. Howley continued, "The Company is revising the full year fiscal 2011

guidance to reflect improved performance, changes to our current market outlook,

disposition of the fastener business as discontinued operations and the sale of

the distribution business. We remain cautious about the defense market but the

commercial markets now appear to be recovering nicely."



Based upon current market conditions and assuming no other acquisitions or

divestitures, the revised guidance is as follows:



Revenues from continuing operations are anticipated to be in the range of $1,172

million to $1,192 million (previously in the range of $1,193 million to $1,225

million which included approximately $70 million from the two divestitures)

compared with $828 million in fiscal 2010; EBITDA As Defined is anticipated to

be in the range of $562 million to $572 million (previously in the range of $546

million to $562 million) compared with $412 million in fiscal 2010;Net income is

anticipated to be in the range of $150 million to $158 million (previously in

the range of $114 million to $135 million) compared with $163 million in fiscal

2010;Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.91 per

share (previously in the range of $2.08 to $2.47 per share) compared with $2.52

per share in fiscal 2010; andAdjusted earnings per share are expected to be in

the range of $3.97 to $4.12 per share (previously in the range of $3.70 to $4.09

per share) compared with $3.35 per share in fiscal 2010.

Non-GAAP Supplemental Information



EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income and

adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this

press release as supplemental disclosures to net income and reported results.

TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation

and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain

non-operating items, effects from the sale on businesses, refinancing costs,

acquisition-related costs, transaction-related costs and non-cash charges

incurred in connection with certain employee benefit plans. TransDigm Group

defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog

amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, refinancing costs,

acquisition-related costs, transaction-related costs and non-cash charges

incurred in connection with certain employee benefit plans. EBITDA As Defined

Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm

Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided

by the total shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more

information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted

net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial

tables.



TransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes

that they are a useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group

believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by

securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating

performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax

rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation

structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In

addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a

company's ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to

measure TransDigm Inc.'s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its

credit facility. TransDigm Group's management also uses EBITDA As Defined to

review and assess its operating performance, to prepare its annual budget and

financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in

connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group's

management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity

measure. In addition, TransDigm Group's management uses adjusted net income as a

measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among

companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and

other factors that affect operating performance.



None of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income

or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under

GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to

net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating

activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.

In addition, TransDigm Group's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures

may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported

by other companies.



Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the

performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use

of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and

you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for

analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some

of these limitations are:



neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense,

or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our

indebtedness;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the

assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the

future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements

for such replacements;the omission of the substantial amortization expense

associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA

and EBITDA As Defined;neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment

of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; andEBITDA As Defined

excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into

our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.



Because of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined should not be

considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the

growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not

viewing EBITDA or EBITDA As Defined in isolation and specifically by using other

GAAP measures, such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure

our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement

of financial performance under GAAP, and neither should be considered as an

alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance

with GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined may not be comparable

to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
