 Notice is hereby given by the Law Office of Alfred G. Yates Jr., PC that it has

filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Northern

District of California on behalf of purchasers of Zynga Inc. ("Zynga") (NASDAQ:

ZNGA) common stock during the period between December 16, 2011 and July 25,

2012, inclusive (the "Class Period").

or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel, Alfred G. Yates
