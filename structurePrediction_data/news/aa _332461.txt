GRANDVILLE, Mich., March 2  /PRNewswire/ -- The composites industry in North

America and Europe made a substantial recovery in 2004 from the slump of the

past three years (2001-2003).  The global composites industry saw a record

growth of 8.7% in 2004 according to a new E-Composites market intelligence

study, "Global Composites Market 2004 - 2010: Opportunities, Market &

Technology."  Total composites consumption in 2004 was 13.5 billion lbs. (6.1

million tons).  According to this new study, all the major market segments

(transportation, construction, pipe & tank, marine, consumer, electrical and

electronics), except the wind energy and aerospace, saw over 5% growth in

composites demand in 2004.  This report covers the status of the composites

industry by the end of 2004, and provides an industry outlook for 2005 and

beyond for major sectors (transportation, aerospace, etc.) of the composites

industry.  Each industry's outlook is determined by its own internal rhythms and

by changes in the overall economy.  In 2005, a lot could change -- for better

and for worse.  Although overall economic growth will be about the same as in

2004, there will be significant changes in growth rates in various market

segments.  Moreover, there will be some shakeup in the ranks of winners and

losers in material suppliers and in end use markets.



"E-Composites forecasts a growth of 5.6% in 2005 for the global composites

industry, with the highest growth rate taking place in the Asia Pacific

marketplace," said Dr. Sanjay Mazumdar, E-Composites' President and CEO.  "In

terms of market segments, wind energy will see the highest growth in 2005 at

over 20%," Mazumdar said.  This 459-page research report also identifies 15

specific applications, which will grow between 5%-50% annually during 2005-

2010.
