MARKET OVERVIEW



Overseas markets appear a bit under the weather, as just four of the 15 markets

that we track are currently positive. The cumulative average return on the group

stands at a minus 0.330 percent.



Before the start of the regular session of trade, Initial Jobless Claims for the

week ending July 3 are expected to have declined by 6,000 reversing some of the

prior week's surprise 1,000 rise. With a somewhat disappointing jobs report out

of June, we would certainly hate to see a trend higher in these weekly initial

jobless reports. At 3:00 p.m., we are expected to learn that May Consumer Credit

rose by 8.0 billion dollars, pretty well dwarfing the prior month's $3.9 billion

increase. It could well be a busy day for the major retailers, as June

same-store sales will be released throughout the session.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



The US markets attempted a mini-comeback Wednesday after news that Iraq repaired

two oil pipelines, broken after being sabotaged. With production threatened by

labor strife in Nigeria, plus Russian oil giant YUKOS in severe financial

trouble, Saudi Arabia and OPEC moved to reassure jittery oil markets that next

month's planned production increase will go ahead. The news sent oil prices

lower and stabilized the markets after several ugly trading days. One company

taking advantage of the oil situation is KCS Energy. As oil prices hit $39 per

barrel, KCS hit a new 52-week high of $14.05 on Wednesday. The oil firm is part

of William Colburn's Value Edge portfolio at the Taipan investment group. KCS

closed at $14.03, which represents a 25% profit for Colburn and his investors

since May 12. Not such a high for Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,

however. Just one day after managing to avoid Italy receiving an EU fine for

breaching the region's budget deficit ceiling, he couldn't escape the verdict of

Standard & Poor on Wednesday. S&P cut Italy's credit rating from AA to AA-.

Having been rated AA since 1993, Italy now embarrassingly holds the same rating

as Slovenia and Andorra. But it's hardly surprising, considering Italy spends

12% of its annual budget paying off interest on its debt, which reached almost

1.3 times GDP last year.
