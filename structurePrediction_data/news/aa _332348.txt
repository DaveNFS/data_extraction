Pew Center Releases Comprehensive Guide to Developing Climate Change-Related

Business Strategies



SECTION: ASSIGNMENT DESK, DAYBOOK EDITOR



LENGTH: 297 words





The Pew Center on Global Climate Change will release a detailed "how to guide"

to help corporate decision makers navigate global markets that are rapidly

changing in response to climate change. Please join us Wednesday, Oct. 18 at the

National Press Club to learn why corporations need to fully integrate climate

factors into their business strategies.



The report, "Getting Ahead of the Curve: Corporate Strategies that Address

Climate Change," lays out a step-by-step approach for companies to reshape their

core business strategies in order to succeed in a marketplace where greenhouse

gases are regulated and carbon-efficiency is in demand.



Of 31 companies polled for this report, nearly all believe that federal

mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. are imminent. Of those,

84 percent expect these standards to take effect before 2015; with a number of

new climate bills forthcoming, it is clear that Congress has entered the design

phase for legislation. Learn how companies are engaging in the policy arena and

incorporating impending regulation into their business strategy.



Author Andy Hoffman from the University of Michigan, as well as representatives

from Alcoa, Duke Energy, DuPont, Whirlpool, Shell and Swiss Re will be on hand

to explain the findings of the report and answer questions.



WHAT: Release of the Pew Center's latest report, "Getting Ahead of the Curve:

Corporate Strategies That Address Climate Change"
