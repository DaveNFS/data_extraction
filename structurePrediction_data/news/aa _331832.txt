Report Highlights:



Nokia Corporation (ADR) (NYSE:NOK): Nokia Siemens Networks, the unprofitable

telephone-equipment venture of Nokia and Siemens, will eliminate 17,000 jobs

worldwide in its biggest cull to narrow the gap with market leader Ericsson AB.

"I think this will be enough," Sami Sarkamies, a Helsinki-based analyst with

Nordea Bank, said in an interview. "It was probably more than people expected.

The big question is how much divestments versus cost savings will be, which

affects how much revenue they are going to lose. With these efforts they should

be able to get above 5 percent margins for earnings before interest and taxes by

late 2012 or 2013." Academic studies have shown that insiders traditionally make

higher investment returns than ordinary investors. Want to find out how they do

it? Read Full Report: http://www.insiderslab.com/PR3/112511A/NOK/Nokia.pdf



Alcoa Inc. (NYSE:AA): Stocks fell, dragging the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to

its longest slump in almost four months, as the U.S. economy grew less than

estimated and Spain's three-month borrowing costs more than doubled at an

auction. Treasuries advanced and commodities climbed. The price of Alcoa dropped

more than 17% this month. The Executive Vice President, Helmut Wieser, sold his

31% shares last week. Want to make a killing on this stock? Check out the

Deere & Company (NYSE:DE): Deere & Co. (DE), the world's largest farm-equipment

maker, reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit and forecast 2012 earnings that

topped analysts' estimates as U.S. farmers flush with cash buying more tractors

and combines. Fiscal 2012 profit will rise to $3.2 billion, the company said in

its initial forecast for the period. That is more than the $2.95 billion average

estimate of 15 analysts. Trading volume climbed up to 12.09 million shares,

which was 3 times more than usual days. Do you want to know when company
