About Fort Sanders School & PTA



Fort Sanders Educational Development Center (Fort Sanders School), built in

1957, is a Knox County, Tennessee public school that serves students with

disabilities from age three through twenty-one. Students receive instruction

from special education teachers, speech therapists, physical therapists,

occupational therapists, audiologists, and instructional support assistants. The

disability level of each student varies with speech or language delays, autism,

Down syndrome, physical disabilities, and health impairments. The school

typically serves between 150-180 students with disabilities each school year. As
