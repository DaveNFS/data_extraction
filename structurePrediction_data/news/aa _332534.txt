DATELINE: AUSTIN, Texas Jan. 26





NetQoS(SM) Inc., network performance experts, today announced the support of

Cisco NetFlow(R) Version 9 by ReporterAnalyzer Version 5. Version 9 of Cisco

Systems' NetFlow, a technology for collecting network traffic information,

features expanded protocol support, and sets the stage for even greater

efficiency in Cisco NetFlow collection.



"Our quick adoption of Cisco NetFlow Version 9, the de facto standard in

Internet Protocol (IP) data flow, is another way that NetQoS is progressively

giving network managers the tools they need to optimize their network and

application performance," said Michael Turner, NetQos executive vice president.

"With an enterprise-wide view of application traffic, ReporterAnalyzer allows

network managers to optimize their infrastructure, troubleshoot, quickly

identify virus and rogue traffic, and plan for the future, whether in capacity

planning or in upgrading NetFlow systems."



ReporterAnalyzer



ReporterAnalyzer is a flexible analysis engine that enables network managers to

understand how application traffic is impacting network performance.

ReporterAnalyzer identifies which applications are using bandwidth, who the

users are, and when the applications are being utilized. ReporterAnalyzer has

the ability to store and report on enterprise-wide Cisco NetFlow data for an

entire year, allowing network managers to make the right decisions regarding

cost reduction, troubleshooting, capacity planning and traffic analysis.



ReporterAnalyzer Version 5 is available immediately, with prices starting at

$50,000.



Cisco NetFlow Version 9



Cisco NetFlow Version 9 stands apart from previous versions in its flexible and

extensible template-based format, which provides the versatility needed to

support new fields and record types. With the ability to export information on

most data types, this new format will support technologies such as Multitask,

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), IP version 6 (Ipv6), and BGP next hop.



In addition, Cisco Netflow Version 9 is the basis for IPFIX (Internet Protocol

Flow Information eXport), the new Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

standard. The IETF recently selected Cisco NetFlow technology from five

candidates as the basis for a standardized commercial IP data export system

because of its broad support and widespread use across the industry. IPFIX, thus

Cisco NetFlow, will provide network managers around the world with easy access

to the operational data needed to manage their networks.
