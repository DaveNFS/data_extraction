DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. Feb. 9





SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 9  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Selectica, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SLTC), a leading provider of sales execution and contract management

solutions, announced today that it has postponed its third quarter fiscal 2006

conference call and webcast that was scheduled for Thursday, February 9, 2006 at

5:00 p.m. Eastern Time/2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.  Selectica and its independent

registered public accounting firm have not yet completed their review of the

third quarter fiscal 2006 financial results.  Selectica will reschedule the

conference call as soon as the review is completed.



Based on preliminary results for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, Selectica

expects to report revenue in the range of $5.1 million to $5.4 million.  Net

loss for the quarter is expected to range from $10.4 million to $10.8 million,

or ($0.32) to ($0.33) per share, which reflects the accrual for a one-time

payment of $7.5 million related to the settlement of patent litigation.

Excluding the accrual for the one-time payment, net loss for the third quarter

of fiscal 2006 is expected to range from $2.9 million to $3.3 million, or

($0.10) to ($0.11) per share.



As of December 31, 2005, Selectica had approximately $91.2 million in cash, cash

equivalents and investments, and no long-term debt.  While the Company accrued

for the one-time payment related to the settlement of patent litigation in the

third quarter of fiscal 2006, the payment will be made in the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2006 in accordance with the terms of the settlement.  As such, the

Company's cash, cash equivalents and investments balance at December 31, 2005

does not reflect the impact of the payment.
