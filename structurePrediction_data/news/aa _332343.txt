The company signed agreements for more than 550,000 square feet of distribution

space during the quarter at ProLogis Park 65, located 8 miles south of the

airport on Interstate 65.  Among the transactions was a lease for 161,000 square

feet with UPS Supply Chain Solutions Inc., the world's largest package delivery

company and a global leader in supply chain services. AmerisourceBergen

Specialty Group, a Dallas-based provider of specialty pharmaceutical services,

also expanded its presence at the park from 200,000 to 275,000 square feet to

support the growth of its business.



"We're extremely pleased with the robust demand we've seen from customers for

space at ProLogis Park 65," said Darin Manning, ProLogis vice president and

market officer.  "The park continues to benefit from its proximity to the

airport and the UPS Worldport hub here, which serves as an important amenity for

companies distributing products regionally and nationally via air freight. We

look forward to expanding our footprint at the park site and to extending our

leadership position in this important distribution market."

park to its maximum capacity of 1.2 million square feet.  Other customers at

consumer electronics and other products, which uses the site as a repair center

for damaged PCs and laptops serving customers nationwide.
