MARKET OVERVIEW



Overseas markets are primarily positive as nine of the 15 markets that we track

are above their respective flat-line values. The cumulative average return on

the group stands at a positive 0.212 percent, bolstered by the 1.92 percent

advance in the Nikkei overnight.



A brief look at last week's market showed that earnings still carry some weight

within the context of this interest rate sensitive environment. This week is

light on economic data, has a few key earnings reports on the docket and a hefty

dose of Federal Reserve and Treasury officials making their rounds. With the

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) set to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday, it

would seem that this week's market could well be on hold, aside from any news

alluding to the "severity" of any interest rate adjustment. With the targeted

deadline of returning the country to Iraqi rule approaching, there is the

potential for increased extra-market news serving as a market driver.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



In an age where terrorism dominates the headlines, a new wave of companies has

suddenly been thrust to the forefront of the massive counter-terrorism industry.

The Taipan investment group is closely monitoring the companies leading the

fight to protect people and places from those intent on wreaking death and

destruction. The group's Red Zone team is bullish on one company in particular -

IPIX Inc - a market leader with its Command View 360 network and video

surveillance camera, which provides a "see everything" function that can look in

all directions with no blind spots. Two weeks ago, the company received a

resounding endorsement from Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge, soaring 51% on

the news, and also got a boost from being a part of the security operation at

the recent G8 Summit. And with other high profile events like the Olympics, the

Democratic and Republican Conventions and the US presidential election just

months away, there could be more upside for IPIX. This undervalued leader has

low debt, enough cash on hand to weather any problems, and the potential to soar

once orders begin flowing in. Ian Cooper, the man who identified IPIX stock as a

winner, scored 246%, 107% and 144% profits for his investors in less than three

weeks in April.
