  COVER STORY: CUSTOMER SERVICE CHAMPS

  By Jena McGregor







Good customer service would seem to be a simple matter. Make policies flexible.

Don't force customers to play call-center phone tag. Hire friendly people, train

them well, and reward them with healthy pay and benefits. But delivering the

right level of customer service turns out to be hard. Some companies struggle to

find smiling teenagers who are willing to work for the minimum wage flipping

burgers. Others have the difficult task of ensuring their customers get the same

message whether they're online, on the phone, or in the store. Slip up, and your

service snafu becomes a tale consumers tell with relish over and over again.

BusinessWeek's special report on customer service digs deep into how companies

are coping with this challenge. It highlights those that won a place among our

2008 Customer Service Champs, a ranking of the best-in-class companies using

data from consumer researcher J.D. Power & Associates. "Customer Service Champs"

tap into three of the top 10 -- USAA, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, and Ace

Hardware -- for their new service initiatives. Plus, it takes an inside look at

why so many subscribers are hanging up on wireless service from Sprint Nextel,

where the new CEO is struggling to fix deep-seated service problems.

  GREEN-UP TO A POINT

  By Ben Elgin









When 10 of the largest U.S. corporations and four environmental groups joined

forces last January to lobby for federal regulations to restrict greenhouse-gas

emissions, it was seen as a watershed in corporate environmentalism. The U.S.

Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), comprising 27 companies from General

Electric to General Motors, won praise from enviros by endorsing cuts -- 10% to

30% of heat-trapping emissions within 15 years and 60% to 80% by 2050 -- to

avert some of the severest consequences of global warming. Behind the scenes,

however, several companies that belong to USCAP are simultaneously supporting

efforts and organizations that oppose mandatory cuts in greenhouse gases or

promote policies that would make the USCAP reductions nearly impossible to meet.

Three high-profile USCAP members -- General Electric, Caterpillar, and Alcoa --

also sit on the board of the Center for Energy & Economic Development (CEED), an

Alexandria (Va.) group formed in 1992 that opposes regulations on greenhouse gas

emissions. In April, 2007, CEED's board unanimously signed a position paper

that, in part, described as "draconian" one federal climate bill that would

require a 65% reduction in emissions by 2050.

  WRANGLING OVER 'REASONABLE' FEES

  By Chad Terhune, with Brian Grow in Atlanta







A new and fearsome player has joined the long-simmering battle between insurers

and health-care providers over how much should be paid for medical procedures.

New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced on Feb. 13 that a six-month

investigation by his office found the nation's biggest health insurers have

systematically defrauded consumers in the state by setting their reimbursement

rates for out-of-network care artificially low. He has issued subpoenas to 16

insurers and intends to sue industry giant UnitedHealth Group. But while Cuomo's

probe centers on Ingenix, a unit of UnitedHealth that is the nation's largest

provider of health-care billing information, experts say reimbursement problems

plague the entire industry. Some of the fiercest clashes over pricing have

involved smaller insurers marketing directly to individuals rather than to big

employers -- firms such as Medical Savings Insurance, a privately held

Indianapolis outfit with just $44.5 million in premiums last year. Medical

Savings has had several flare-ups in the 33 states in which it is licensed to

sell policies.

  AN AD MAN TESTS THE LIMITS

  By Burt Helm, with Jack Ewing, Andrea Zammert, and Carol Matlack







Wherever media and advertising executives gather -- from future-of-the-industry

confabs to magazine award luncheons -- you will find a 58-year-old man with the

haggard look of someone who would rather think than sleep. He rarely seeks

people out at these events, but lets them come to him. And come they do: CEOs,

CMOs, and network bigs, all jostling for face time. Eventually this man will

mount the stage. A reverent hush will descend. Irwin Gotlieb, the most powerful

man on Madison Avenue, is about to speak. In his pensive, reedy voice, Gotlieb

will typically lay out his vision of the future: billions of consumers in a

global bazaar of digital media, advertisers seeking them out with hyper-targeted

ads, can't-miss analytics. And he will inevitably explain why his media-buying

company, GroupM, will remain central even as the world moves online. Clients,

Wall Streeters, media executives -- all listen because Gotlieb is the world's

most successful media buyer. But at a time when recession is in the air and ad

spending is tepid, it's getting harder to keep profits growing briskly for his

increasingly demanding overlords at parent WPP. So he is looking for new ways to

earn money in the U.S., the world's largest advertising market. Gotlieb is known

as a Digital Age oracle. But he is putting a new twist on a surprisingly

old-fashioned moneymaking model -- one that has been banned in France since 1993

and now is under fire in Germany. The practice is known in the advertising

industry as a rebate or "volume override."

  PREPAID CARDS: THE CLEANUP

  By Ben Levisohn







The world's oldest profession is using one of the newest financial products. At

high-end escort service Hush Hush in Charlotte, N.C., prepaid cards were the

preferred method of payment. Hush Hush madam Sallie Wamsley-Saxon, who pled

guilty in federal court to charges of prostitution and money laundering in early

February, used the cards to transfer funds to her "Southern Belles," as she

called the escorts, or collect money from clients who paid up to $700 an hour.

With many of the features of a standard debit or credit card and far more

anonymity, prepaid cards have become a vital link in the money-laundering chain.

They work pretty simply: At a store or online, consumers load cash onto plastic

that can legitimately be used at retailers and ATMs. It's that ease of use, in

part, that has attracted criminals. "[Prepaid] cards provide a compact, easily

transportable way, and potentially anonymous way to store and access cash,"

warns a federal government report on money laundering. Prosecutors' growing

focus on prepaid-card crime has prompted the trade group Network Branded Prepaid

Card Assn. to develop industry guidelines, released on Feb. 25. And a recent

court settlement may force companies to implement stricter controls that detect

and prevent bad acts, which may lead some players to exit the business.

  BEHIND THE MESS AT UBS

  By Stanley Reed







Swiss banking giant UBS is the most mauled European financial player in the

global credit crisis. The bank took $18.4 billion in write-offs last year from

subprime mortgage securities gone bad -- and it still has at least an $80

billion exposure to risky securities on its books. Last December, UBS had to

line up a $12 billion capital injection from the Government of Singapore

Investment Corp. and an unidentified Middle Eastern investor. And future

writedowns at UBS are probable. It's all a surprising twist for a once-

conservative lender and dominant force in private banking that has some $2

trillion in assets under management. Now the unfolding drama, which has already

cost Chief Executive Peter A. Wuffli his job, clouds the bank's future.

  LIGHTS! CAMERA! INSURANCE!

  By Ronald Grover







On their big night, Oscar winners often use their acceptance speeches to thank

everyone from their parents to their nutritionists. But the odds are pretty good

that no one will mention Roger Nulton or Joe Finnegan during the Feb. 24

ceremony. Maybe they should. In the world of megamillion-dollar productions, the

two Fireman's Fund Insurance executives have become unlikely Hollywood power

players whose nods launch productions -- and whose checkbooks often save them.

This year the insurer covered Best Picture nominees Atonement and Michael

Clayton, as well as 14 other films up for awards. As the average cost of making

a major movie surpasses $65 million -- and risks, from terrorism threats to

rehab-prone actors, have multiplied -- an insurance broker can be a producer's

best friend. For the insurers, the business provides hefty margins, a way to

diversify, plus a touch of glamour.

  GORE, GELDOF, VENTER ... AND THIS GUY?

  By Stephen Baker







Al Gore will be there. Sir Bob Geldof is on the bill. So is Craig Venter, the

genomic pioneer. As scores of global glitterati gather in Monterey, Calif., on

Feb. 27 at the technology, entertainment, and design conference known as TED,

they'll be joined by a 21-year-old who wears low-slung pants and an oversize

coat. That would be Ben Kaufman, CEO of a Burlington (Vt.) software startup

called Kluster. Kaufman has landed an entire room at TED -- precious real estate

-- to demo his new social network. It's a Web site that brings people together

to generate new ideas, products, and designs. If all goes according to plan, the

event's great minds and celebs will converge on Kluster's virtual world to turn

an idea, in the course of 72 hours, into a prototype -- ideally something that

will help fight disease, slow global warming, or ease the plight of the poor.
