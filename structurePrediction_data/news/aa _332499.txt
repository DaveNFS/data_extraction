German Alumina Business to be Sold



SECTION: FINANCIAL NEWS



LENGTH: 566 words



DATELINE: OSLO, Norway June 28





Hydro has entered into an agreement to sell its German based alumina business.

This consists of a 50 per cent share in Aluminium Oxid Stade GmbH (AOS), the

related chemical grade alumina business and the dedicated bauxite supply source

represented by Hydro's 10 per cent share in Halco (Mining) Inc.



The Dadco Group, which owns the remaining 50 per cent of AOS, has purchased

these operations for a consideration of approximately NOK 750 million. In

addition, Dadco will assume all financial, commercial and all other obligations

related to the business. The transaction will not result in any significant gain

or loss for Hydro.



Dadco is a privately owned investment, manufacturing and trading group; its

founding company was established in 1915.



AOS is an alumina refinery located in Stade, near Hamburg in Northern Germany

with a total capacity of 850,000 tonnes of alumina. About half of Hydro's share

of alumina is chemical grade alumina used in a variety of applications in the

chemical and other industries, which are non-core to Hydro's aluminium

activities. Halco (Mining) Inc. owns 51 per cent of CBG, one of the largest

bauxite mines in the world located in Guinea. Other shareholders in Halco are

Alcoa and Alcan.



AOS will continue to produce alumina to supply Hydro's wholly owned primary

aluminium unit in Stade and Hamburger Aluminium-Werk, in which Hydro has a 33

per cent shareholding, through a long term supply agreement with Dadco, thereby

securing a long-term industrial solution for all parties.
