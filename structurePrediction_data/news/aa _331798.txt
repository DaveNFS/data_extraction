SHELBURNE, ON, March 19, 2012 /PRNewswire/ - This new optimal aging website for

older adults provides easy to understand articles about the benefits of physical

activity and healthy living. Written by experts in their field, articles are

based on current research.



Identifying a need for reliable on-line research-based information for older

adults, the Active Living Coalition for Older Adults (ALCOA) is pleased to

announce the launch of silvertimes.ca and bellesannees.ca in both English and

French. The silvertimes.ca and belleannees.ca websites are truly Canadian

websites - published in both official languages - and written specifically for

older Canadian adults.



Dr. M.T. Sharratt, PhD., an Executive Member of ALCOA: "Everything I have

learned in my years researching the health of older adults reconfirms that it is

never too late to benefit from physical activity and healthy living!

Silvertimes.ca and bellesannees.ca provide older adults with the evidence-based

information and tools that will help them to make informed lifestyle choices. I

know that if you take our message of daily activity and optimal living to heart,

you will see positive benefits in how you feel, and how you live."



Evidence based information, is offered in six areas of interest: physical

activity, men's and women's health, safety at home, mental & spiritual health,

plus a section for those living with a chronic disease. These six areas have one

or more articles with ideas and practical solutions for healthy living and a new

article will be posted every two weeks. Each article is not just about giving

good ideas - it is written to inspire!
