Following several years of losses, industrial employment in Iowa increased by

about one percent in 2011, according to the 2012 Iowa Manufacturers Register®,

an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers' News, Inc. (MNI)

Evanston, IL. MNI reports Iowa gained 1,929 industrial jobs between January 2011

and January 2012, in contrast to the 1.4% loss MNI reported for the 2010-2011

survey period.



Manufacturers' News reports Iowa is now home to 5,489 manufacturers employing

264,216 workers.



"The recovery is gaining momentum in Iowa and across the U.S.," says Tom Dubin,

President of the Evanston, IL-based publishing company, which has been surveying

industry since 1912. "The state's educated workforce, friendly business

environment, and investments in green technologies have been a draw for a

variety of enterprises."



Bright spots for the state included the opening of Plumrose USA's new pork

processing plant in Council Bluffs; the opening of Vi-COR's new livestock feed

manufacturing facility in Mason City; Poet-DSM Advanced Biofuels' planned

cellulosic ethanol plant in Emmetsburg; and the expansion of Green Plains

Renewable Energy's algae production facility in Shenandoah. Alcoa plans to

expand its rolled-products facility in Davenport; Pinnacle Food recently

expanded its Fort Madison canned meat factory; and Deere & Company plans an

expansion of its Waterloo site.



Food products manufacturing remains Iowa's largest industrial sector by

employment with 56,811 jobs, with no significant change reported over the year.

Industrial machinery and equipment ranks second with 46,366 jobs, up 1.9%.

Third-ranked fabricated metals account for 20,860 jobs, up a half percent over

the past twelve months.



Sectors that lost jobs over the past twelve months included lumber/wood down

5.5%; printing/publishing down 3.2%; furniture/fixtures, down 2.8%; paper

products, down 1.5%; and rubber/plastics, down 1%. Employment remained steady in

electronics and instruments/related products, while gains were seen in primary

metals, up 6.2%; transportation equipment, up 4.2%; and textiles/apparel, up

1.1%.



Industrial locations closing in Iowa included R.R. Donnelley's printing plant in

Eldridge; a Thomas & Betts facility in Clinton; ConAgra's popcorn processing

factory in Hamburg; and River Bend Industries' facility in North Liberty,

although the company will expand operations at its Victor location.



The East Central region of Iowa accounts for the most industrial employment in

the state with 92,287 jobs, up 1% over the year. Southeast Iowa is home to

59,489 industrial workers, up 1%, while the West Central region accounts for

50,330, with no significant change reported. Northeast Iowa saw manufacturing

declined 1.2% in Northwest Iowa, with the region currently home to 22,665

industrial workers. Southwest Iowa accounts for 16,070 manufacturing jobs, up

1.2%.
