An interactive afternoon dialogue with members of the Institute will be followed

by an evening program featuring guest speaker, Atul Gawande, MD, MPH. Dr.

Gawande, a general and endocrine surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in

Boston, is known for his writing on topics in medicine, health care quality, and

health reform. A staff writer at the New Yorker magazine since 1998, Dr. Gawande

has authored three books that have appeared on the New York Times Bestseller

list, the most recent of which, The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things

Right, examines the use of checklists to perform complex work.



Dr. Gawande served as a senior health policy adviser in the Clinton presidential

campaign and White House from 1992 to 1993. In 2006, he received a MacArthur

Award for his research and writing. He is a recipient of AcademyHealth's Impact

Award for highest research impact on health care, and was named by Foreign

Policy Magazine and TIME magazine as one of the world's top 100 influential

thinkers.



"Dr. Gawande's writings and insights are an inspiration to health care

professionals and the public at large," said Diane C. Pinakiewicz, president of

the National Patient Safety Foundation and the Lucian Leape Institute at NPSF.

"We are honored to welcome him to share his thoughts on future developments in

health care.



The Lucian Leape Institute at NPSF functions as a think tank to identify new

approaches to improving patient safety. Members of the Institute comprise

national thought leaders with an interest or expertise in the patient safety

field. During the afternoon Forum, Institute members will offer insights into

their work. Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions and participate

in a discussion about concepts that may help transform the health care and

patient safety landscape.

Leape, MD, adjunct professor of health policy, Harvard School of Public Health;

Quality; James B. Conway, MS, adjunct faculty, Harvard School of Public Health;
