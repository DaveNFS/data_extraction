Report Highlights:



Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS): Morgan Stanley surged 2.94% to US$13.64 with more than

18.59 million shares traded hands, compared to its average volume of 31.55

million shares. On Tuesday, Carl Davey, head of prime brokerage sales in

Singapore, resigned from the company to join Citigroup. The investment firm has

been sued by multiple investors over its role in Facebook's IPO. Investors

claimed that the bank reduced its earnings estimate on the company while the IPO

was under process and those estimates were sent to limited numbers of its

clients. In early March, analyst Donald Jones at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.

expected the company bank's credit ranking from Moody's Investors Service to

downgrade by two notches over the next two months. He said that there is a 75%

possibility of downgrade. In April, the bank had reported better than estimated

first-quarter earnings driven by strong trading revenue. The bank reported loss

of US$119 million, or 6 cents per share, reversing loss of US$736 million, or 50

cents per share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the firm would have earned

US$1.4 billion, or 71 cents a share. Revenue during the latest quarter came in

at US$6.9 billion. Trading revenue surged 33% year over year US$5 billion.

Shares of MS have slumped over 10% so far this year, one of the biggest losers

in the financial sector. Are insiders starting to take huge profits by buying

shares or exercising stock options? Academic studies have shown that insiders

traditionally make higher investment returns than ordinary investors. Want to

find out how they do it?

Western Digital Corporation (NYSE:WDC): Western Digital ended lower by US$1.04

or down 3.04% to US$33.17 on over 7.49 million shares, above its average volume

of 6 million shares. On Tuesday, analyst at Barclays Capital reduced its

investment rating on the stock to equal weight from overweight, citing higher

inventories and reduced demand could hurt the company's earnings. The firm

trimmed its price target by US$12 to US$37. The company recently announced that

it will shift its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the NASDAQ Global

Select Market in order to save on the listing fees and improve the public

exposure. The company's shares will start trading in NASDAQ on June 1, 2012 with

the ticker WDC. The company also announced to increase its buyback target by

another US$1.50 billion and extended the repurchase program by five years.

Shares of WDC have outperformed the broader market so far this year and sell

over 7% in the past year. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has been moving

within a range of US$22.64 - US$44.44. Pennystocksinsiders.com found James J.

Murphy, Chairman of the Board, sold 15,000 shares on May 25. Since insiders such

as CEOs, CFOs and Directors have better access to company non-public

information, Pennystocksinsiders.com thinks that investors would be wise to pay

close attention to their stock trading behaviors. Check this insider trade

report for WDC here.

target on the stock to US$51, while maintaining its Overweight rating. The firm

noted that the company has impressive gross margin in its ABC TV unit, and its

summer blockbuster movie, The Avengers, has performed strongly at the box

office. Last week, analyst at Nomura Securities lifted its price target on the

stock by US$3 to US$51 and maintained its buy rating on the stock. The company's

shares have jumped over 5% after reporting higher than estimated second-quarter

earnings in early May. The company earned US$1.14 billion, or 63 cents a share,

up from a year ago profit of US$942 million, or 49 cents a share. On an adjusted

basis, the company would have earned 58 cents per share, topped analysts'

estimates by 3 cents. Quarterly revenue surged 6% year over year to US$9.63

billion from US$9.08 billion, ahead of analysts' projections of US$9.57 billion.
