DATELINE: NEW YORK,  Jan. 15





Mr. John Paulson, president of the firm, said: "Few people, if any, in the world

have the breadth of experience with, and depth of understanding of, global

financial markets as Dr. Greenspan. Anticipating the direction of the economy,

and assessing the potential for and severity of a U.S. recession, are

fundamental in formulating current investment strategy. Dr. Greenspan's position

as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for 18 years, through multiple market

cycles, gives him a unique perspective from which to help our investment

management team make critical decisions."



Dr. Alan Greenspan said: "Paulson & Co. Inc. is one of the world's leading hedge

funds. I look forward to adding my perspectives on the global economy to that of

Mr. Paulson and his team."



Financial terms were not disclosed.
