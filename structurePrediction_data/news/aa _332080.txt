TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, West Indies, April 27 /PRNewswire/ -- CariSal Investment

Holdings (BVI) Ltd. is pleased to announce that its subsidiary, CariSal

Unlimited, has been granted a Certificate of Environmental Clearance by the

Environmental Management Authority for the construction of its

Chlor-Alkali/Calcium Chloride Plant in the new Point Lisas South and East

Industrial Estate.



Construction of the plant is expected to start during the third quarter of 2009,

with commercial operation commencing by late 2010. CariSal will then be the

second largest dry calcium chloride plant in the Western Hemisphere and the

largest caustic soda plant in the West Indies. The facility will nominally

produce 100,000 mt caustic soda, 70,000 mt pure pellet and 78,000 mt pure flake

calcium chloride per annum. The company has signed a 10-year agreement with

Alcoa World Alumina LLC to supply caustic soda from the plant after start-up.



CariSal, which was formed in September 2005, aims to be a leading supplier of

caustic soda, calcium chloride and other related products to Trinidad, the

Caribbean, Latin America and North America, and West Africa, for the oilfield

services, road construction, ice-melt, and other markets. CariSal also supplies

ClearPath(TM) to the US ice-melt market. It has operations in Middletown, New

York and Trinidad and Tobago.



In August 2008, CariSal announced a $50 million investment from Denham Capital.

Other sponsors include INNOVAONE Investments of Trinidad and Tobago

("INNOVAONE"), Seneca Chemical ("Seneca") and TTeK Project Management Limited

("TTeK") and Easi Industrial Supplies Limited (EISL).
