EVANSTON, Ill., Aug.18 /PRNewswire/ -- Industrial employment in Wisconsin fell

5% over the past twelve months according to the 2010 Wisconsin Manufacturers

Register(R), an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers' News,

Inc. (MNI) Evanston, IL. MNI reports Wisconsin lost 31,296 industrial jobs and

413 manufacturers between June 2008 and June 2009, the sharpest decline MNI has

ever reported in the twenty-five years it has been tracking the state's

industry.

Manufacturers' News reports Wisconsin is now home to 12,026 manufacturers

employing 600,017 workers.



"As with the entire nation, the recession continues to affect Wisconsin's

industrial sectors, with the auto industry and sectors related to the housing

market taking the biggest hit," says Tom Dubin, President of the Evanston,

IL-based publishing company, which has been surveying industry since 1912.

"However, the state's educated workforce and strong exports should help lay the

groundwork for recovery,"



Transportation equipment manufacturing saw the worst drop in employment, down

20% over the past twelve months due partially to the shutdowns at GM's

Janesville assembly plant and the Janesville Lear Corp plant, which closed in

December. As a result, industrial employment in Janesville fell 45%. Other auto

industry manufacturers shutting down include Alcoa Wheel Products, which

shuttered its Beloit plant in March.



Manufacturers associated with the housing industry also saw declines over the

year with employment in lumber and wood down 8.3% and furniture/fixtures down

3.2%.



Industrial machinery and equipment remains the state's top sector by

manufacturing employment with 105,816 jobs, down 3.9% over the year. Fabricated

metal products account for 67,206 jobs, down 5.4%, while third-ranked food

products manufacturing accounts for 66,447 jobs, down 1.2% over the past twelve

months.



Most other industrial sectors in Wisconsin lost jobs within the past year and

included primary metals manufacturing, down 6.1%; printing/publishing down 5.4%;

rubber/plastics down 5.1%; paper products down 4.9%; electronics down 4.6% and

stone/clay/glass down 2.3%. Employment in chemicals manufacturing remained

steady, according to MNI.



Bright spots for the state include the planned expansion of Oshkosh Corporation,

a manufacturer of commercial vehicles that will be stepping up production of

all-terrain vehicles for the U.S. armed forces, creating 300-500 jobs. The

continued increase in exports from Wisconsin--rising 13% from 2007 to 2008

according to government data--has also helped to offset losses.



Manufacturers' News reports Southeast Wisconsin saw the largest drop in

employment, down 6.1% over the year with the region currently accounting for

324,967 jobs or 54% of the state. Manufacturing employment declined 4.1% in

Southwest Wisconsin, with the region currently home to 47,429 jobs, while

Northern Wisconsin suffered a 3.8% drop and is currently home to 38,318 jobs.

Central Wisconsin saw a 3.4% decline and currently accounts for 189,303 of the

state's manufacturing jobs, according to MNI.



MNI's city data shows Milwaukee is Wisconsin's top city for manufacturing

employment, home to 60,467 jobs, with jobs down 4% over the year. Second-ranked

Green Bay accounts for 23,694 jobs, with employment down 2.9%. Madison is home

to 19,058 industrial jobs, down 3.1% over the year, while Waukesha accounts for

17,320 jobs, down 3.5%. Appleton is home to 14,641, down 7.9% over the past

twelve months.
