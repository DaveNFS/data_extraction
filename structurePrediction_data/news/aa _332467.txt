MARKET OVERVIEW



Treasuries were mixed in yesterday's trading as traders found certain places on

the yield curve to be more comfortable than others.  Overall, however, yields on

shorter-term maturities continue to rise faster than longer-term maturities.  As

such, the 2-30 year yield spread is narrowing, and the yield curve is

flattening.  The yields on the 2-year and 10-year notes stood at 3.214 percent

and 4.275 percent respectively, rising as the notes fell.  The 2-30 year yield

spread stood at 161 basis points.



The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.32 points during U.S. trading yesterday.  The

greenback pulled back mainly due to profit taking, as investors decided to cash

in on the recent rally that sent the buck to its highest levels in weeks. The

dollar fell 0.3 percent against the euro to $1.3082, and lost 0.6 percent versus

the yen to trade at 104.16 yen.  Comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow

regarding the Bush administration's strong dollar policy helped to provide the

power behind the recent dollar rally, but many investors still believe that the

U.S. currency is in serious trouble.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



Although J.P. Morgan says India will be the least affected economically, the

country just raised its tsunami tab to US$1.6 billion. With over 10,000 Indians

confirmed dead and around 5,700 missing, citizens have donated generously,

pumping three billion rupees (US$68.4 million) into the relief fund. In addition

to that and money from foreign disaster funds, the government has provided

US$113 million. As one of the fastest-growing emerging market nations, India's

economy is well placed to cope with the tragedy. Following 8.2% GDP growth last

year, the current situation isn't expected to dent the economy too much, with

the country still on track to post 6.5% expansion this year. On a wider scale,

2005's first meeting of G10 central bankers saw the group project global GDP

growth at around 4%. If this happens, it would represent a solid year,

considering the many factors combining to drag growth down. This includes high

oil prices, a falling dollar (coupled with a rising euro and British pound,

which is helping to stall the export market) and, of course, terrorists who

persistently wish to wreak havoc and destruction. And a report from the Federal

Reserve shows US consumer debt down by a hefty US$8.7 billion in November - the

largest monthly fall since January 1943. This comes after a recent Associated

Press poll found that half of Americans consistently worry about the debt

they've accrued, be it through loans or credit cards, and almost one-fifth said

they don't trust themselves to manage their own debts.
