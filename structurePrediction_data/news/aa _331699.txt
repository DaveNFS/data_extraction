Advanced Glazing Systems Markets - 2012



According to building engineers, backed up by the evidence of infrared

photography, the vast majority of energy loss in buildings is through windows.

In an era of rising real energy prices and uncertainties about future energy

supply NanoMarkets believes that a fast growing market for advanced glazing

systems can be expected and that this will create profitable business

opportunities for a wide variety of companies.

In this new report, NanoMarkets has identified where these opportunities can be

found and how much they will be worth.  The report covers the full range of

high-performance windows systems that provide thermal, visual and IR management

using the latest materials:



In this report, firms in the windows/glazing industry will find a comprehensive

product roadmap for advanced glazing systems showing how windows products will

evolve from the latest generation of highly insulated windows, through the

incorporation of various dynamic glass (aka smart windows) technologies, and

then on to systems with embedded solar and lighting functionality.  Included in

the analysis in this report is an examination of some of the high performance

insulated windows and dynamic glass windows products that are already on the

market Because of the huge potential addressable market for high-tech windows

and the fact that they are likely to use novel materials, this report also

includes a comprehensive discussion and forecast of how materials needs will

change in the glazing systems market over the next eight years and how materials

and chemical firms can benefit from these changes.  Among the materials covered

will be smart materials, photoactive materials, glasses, plastics, framing

materials, sealants, gasses, desiccants, etc. NanoMarkets also believe that this

report will also be of considerable interest to both the solar panel industry

and the solid-state lighting industry.  Firms active in these industries will

learn from this report how they can tap into the expected rapid growth of

advanced glazing systems.  In particular, we show how new opportunities will

emerge for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) companies and OLED firms to

make money  by implanting PV and lighting layers into high-performance windows

products



This report will also bring considerable insights to corporate planners

throughout the building products and construction industries as well as

architects and sophisticated investors.  As with all NanoMarkets reports, this

report contains detailed eight-year forecasts of the markets analyzed in this

report in both value ($ millions) and volume (area) terms.  Forecast breakouts

are by end-user type, technology, materials used and geography.  In addition,

the report contains a thorough analysis of the product/market strategies of the

leading firms currently active in the advanced glazing space.  And both giant

firms - such as Alcoa, Saint-Gobain and Bayer - and the latest startups are

included in the coverage.
