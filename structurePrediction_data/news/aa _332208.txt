CHAPEL HILL, N.C., April 15 /PRNewswire/ -- With companies across all industries

facing a year of belt-tightening, organizations are seeking savings from the

To help executives and managers in pharma and other sectors evaluate their key

HR functions, benchmarking leader Best Practices, LLC has published a
