LENGTH: 2146 words



DATELINE: REDWOOD CITY, Calif., May 5, 2011





Codexis, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDXS) today announced financial results for the first

quarter ended March 31, 2011.



First Quarter Financial Highlights:



Revenue: For the first quarter of 2011, the company reported revenues of $31.0

million, an increase of 21% from $25.7 million in the first quarter of 2010.

Product revenue of $12.9 million increased 106% over the same time period driven

by more than $5 million in sales of the boceprevir intermediate to be used in

Merck's investigational Hepatitis C drug trade named Victrelis. Collaborative

R&D revenue of $2.7 million increased from $0.7 million in the first quarter of

2010, driven mainly by funded research for our carbon capture program.



Operating Expenses: Research and development expenses in the first quarter of

2011 were $13.8 million, compared to $13.0 million for the first quarter of

2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in amortization related to

intellectual property purchased from Maxygen, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2010

and higher depreciation and stock compensation expenses. Selling, general and

administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2011 increased to $9.0 million

compared to $8.6 million over the same period of 2010, driven by higher stock

compensation expense and higher compensation expense due to headcount increases.



Net Loss: Net loss was ($3.5) million, or ($0.10) per share, based on 35.1

million weighted average common shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2011.

This compares to a net loss of ($1.4) million or ($0.50) per share during the

first quarter of 2010.



Adjusted EBITDA: On a non-GAAP basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $2.8

million in the first quarter of 2010 to $1.8 million in 2011. Adjusted EBITDA is

calculated by adjusting net loss for net interest expense, income taxes,

depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and preferred stock warrant

fair market valuation. A reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is

presented below.



Cash: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 2011,

increased to $82.0 million compared to $74.0 million at December 31, 2010. The

company generated $7.3 million in cash from operations in the first quarter.



Outlook



Codexis' statements with regard to its outlook are based on current

expectations. The following statements are forward looking, and actual results

could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth

under "Forward-Looking Statements" below.



For the full year 2011, Codexis forecasts revenues of $120 million or greater,

which would represent growth of 12% or greater compared to 2010. Codexis expects

2011 Adjusted EBITDA will be $5 million or greater.



Recent Events



On April 7, 2011, Codexis announced a partnership with Alcoa and CO2 Solution,

Inc. for a carbon capture technology pilot test designed to turn emissions into

beneficial commercial products. The collaboration will use proprietary enzyme

technologies to reduce the environmental impact of industrial byproducts. This

new pilot program will be funded by Alcoa and includes $13.5 million from the

U.S. Department of Energy.



On March 8, 2011, Codexis named Jacques Beaudry-Losique VP Corporate Development

& Strategy. Mr. Beaudry-Losique joined Codexis from the U.S. Department of

Energy, and is responsible for corporate strategic planning for Codexis'

programs.



On February 17, 2011, Codexis announced that Byron Dorgan, former U.S. Senator

from North Dakota, had been elected to the company's Board of Directors. Senator

Dorgan retired from the Senate in January 2011 after a 30-year career in the

U.S. Congress.



On January 25, 2011, Codexis signed its first Japanese biocatalysis

collaboration with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, one of the ten largest Japanese

pharmaceutical manufacturers. Under the agreement, Codexis will supply

biocatalysis screening products and services to DSP for use in selected

undisclosed therapeutic products in its development pipeline.



On January 12, 2011, Codexis signed an enzyme supply agreement with DSM

Pharmaceutical Products, the custom manufacturing organization of Royal DSM NV.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information



In this press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, we present

Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in

comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by

excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating

performance. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the effectiveness

of our business strategies.



A reconciliation of GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is included in the table

below.

valuation adjustment



Adjusted EBITDA                                           $ 1,760   $ 2,787



Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations

are:



Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements,

for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;Adjusted EBITDA does not

reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;Although

depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated

and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA

does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; andNon-cash

compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive

compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our

ongoing operating performance for a particular period.



Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in

isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance

with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP

results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.
