MARKET OVERVIEW



Overseas markets are unanimously bullish this morning as all the markets that we

track are in the green. The prospect of a rally on Wall Street, together with

gains in the oil and telecom sectors led the FTSE higher by some 0.80 %.  The

Nikkei was pushed higher by shipping and steel. In Hong Kong, Hutchinson led the

Hang Seng higher by 1.24%. The BSE continues to maintain itself above the 6000

mark despite uncertainty related with the Reliance group.



The U.S. Dollar Index tumbled 0.40 points, once again making a fresh new

multi-year low.  It is now looking more and more like the dollar is going down

to the 80 level that we mentioned here several weeks ago as a target.  So long

as the Index stays below its 10-day moving average expect the selling to

continue.  The dollar sold-off hard on Friday thanks to reports that China was

beginning to trim some of its dollar exposure.  You really can't blame them too

much, as they have been losing value on anything backed by the dollar the past

few years.  It is news like this that the Fed doesn't want to hear, as it could

lead to a barrage of selling as foreigners in unison dump their dollars.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



With Thanksgiving and "Black Friday" (the busiest shopping day of the year)

already now gone, will this be the season to be jolly for retailers? A time that

accounts for 40-50% of annual revenues. If figures from Mastercard Advisors are

any indication, the prospects look bright. The group reports that more Americans

are shopping early, sending retail sales up 3.7% over the first two weeks of

November. Nielsen/NetRatings also said today that web traffic at online

retailers jumped 60% week-over-week for the seven days ending November 14.

Home/garden sites saw an 88% traffic spike, with Home Depot and Pottery Barn

posting increases of 159% and 97%, respectively. Book/music sites like

Amazon.com recorded a similar 87% volume surge. Traffic to Barnes and Noble's

website was up an astonishing 233%. Toy/video game sites witnessed an 85% gain,

while apparel stores enjoyed a 75% advance, led by a 245% swell at Gap's

website. All this comes after a survey by the Consumer Federation of America and

Credit Union National Association that showed 17% of respondents planning to

spend more this festive season, compared with 15% who said so last year. Market

research firm Unity Marketing expands on this by saying that consumers who said

they will spend more will do so by 5.6% -- an estimated US$678, US$30 more than

last year. Naturally, online shopping will prove to be very popular, with

several research firms projecting a 23-29% sales spike (depending on which study

you look at) during November and December, compared with 2003. That's in excess

of US$15 billion. The National Retail Federation says total US retail spending

in November and December will hit approximately US$220 billion -- a 4.5% over

the same period in 2003.
