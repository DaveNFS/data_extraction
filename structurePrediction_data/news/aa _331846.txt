Investors can easily trade top penny stocks online now. Many online stock

brokers provide free equity research reports for their clients. However, many of

them do not provide insider trading research reports. Penny stock companies

often lack transparency. They rarely do investment firm research analysis and

issue research reports for penny stocks. As such, monitoring insider trading

activities may be the only way to find out more information about a penny stock

company's real financial situation.

Research Report Highlights:



Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF): Stock Shares Acquired by Group Insiders



Insider Trade Signals: Although economists worried over the summer that the

economic recovery was slowing, recent Federal Reserve data showed that business

loans rose 2.4% in the third quarter from the second to just over $1 trillion.

Meanwhile, credit-card loans, which are down 3.6% from a year earlier as

households continue to pay down debt, rose a very slight 0.7% from the second

quarter. In recent quarters, regional banks have begun to post improved credit

quality. More detailed credit checks have led to fewer delinquent loans and

greater financial stability. As such, banks are setting aside less money to

cover bad loans and some are seeing loan losses receding. Want to know what

returns these insiders are seeing at Regions Financial?
