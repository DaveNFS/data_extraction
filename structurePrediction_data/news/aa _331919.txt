DATELINE: NEW YORK, April 7, 2011





NEW YORK, April 7, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Alcoa (NYSE: AA) today announced a new

pilot program, in collaboration with Codexis, Inc. (Nasdaq: CDXS) and CO2

Solution Inc. (TSX-V: CST), focused on carbon capture technology designed to

sequester industrial carbon emissions, neutralizing the material to create a

commercially viable product.



The project is the latest innovation from the world's leading aluminum producer

and will be funded by Alcoa along with approximately $13.5 million in funding

from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) received from an award with the

National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). This funding was made available by

the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).



The pilot program, part of Alcoa's ongoing commitment to enhance its operational

sustainability, will use an innovative and proprietary in-duct scrubber

technology to capture emissions. The collaboration is intended to devise

solutions that treat and utilize a primary byproduct of the aluminum

manufacturing process known as alkaline clay, or bauxite residue, as well as

other alkaline industrial residuals. This pilot project will test a scrubbing

process that combines treated flue gas, enzymes and alkaline clay to create a

mineral-rich neutralized product that could be used for environmental

reclamation projects. The project is emblematic of how Alcoa is leveraging its

extensive R&D capabilities and utilizing game-changing technologies from

companies such as Codexis and CO2 Solution to advance sustainable solutions that

can have an impact beyond Alcoa's operations.



"Our mission at Alcoa is to create a more sustainable world through innovative

solutions and responsible operations," said Kevin Anton, Alcoa's Chief

Sustainability Officer. "Finding ways to turn industrial waste into beneficial

products will create a more sustainable society for generations to come. We are

committed to this project and partnership because it epitomizes our belief that

sustainable technologies are fundamental for the maintenance of vital resources

and, therefore, for our business."



Scientists and engineers from Alcoa Technical Center in Pittsburgh will lead the

three-year project, which has an investigation phase that runs through December.

Upon successful completion of this phase, the project will proceed to the pilot

testing phase. The DOE grant was received as part of an initiative to find ways

of converting captured carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources into

useful products such as fuels, plastics, cement and fertilizers.



"We are very pleased to be expanding deployment of our carbon capture technology

with Alcoa," said Dr. Alan Shaw, Codexis president and CEO. "We recently

reported significant progress in our first program to reduce CO2 emissions from

coal-fired power plants. With this agreement, we are expanding to a second large

market where our technology can add real economic value, and where it may

convert industrial waste to new, valuable products."



Glenn Kelly, CO2 Solution president and CEO, commented on the new partnership,

saying, "We are delighted to be building on our relationship with Alcoa to

support this important technology development and further expand into U.S. and

global markets. This represents a significant new application of our technology,

and we are pleased to be working with Alcoa as a global leader towards its

realization."



Codexis and CO2 Solution have been collaborating since late 2009 on the

development of custom carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes and processes that could

significantly decrease the cost of carbon dioxide capture from industrial

sources. CA is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of carbon dioxide in

nature, and program results to date show that the technology can be used to

create and deploy CA biocatalysts with substantially improved stability and

performance under industrial conditions.
