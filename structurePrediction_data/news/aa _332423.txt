MARKET OVERVIEW



In overseas trading, 13 of the 15 markets that we track are showing gains. In

London, the FTSE is up 0.44, and the French and German markets are faring even

better, with the CAC 40 up 0.60 and the DAX up 0.64. Trailing the way is Sydney,

down 0.8 percent. But the star of the show was the Japanese market, up almost

2.5 percent, the largest gain in more than three years.



The November futures contract on sweet crude oil moved 0.78 percent higher on

Monday.  Meanwhile, November Unleaded Gas futures dropped 0.61 percent,

continuing last week's downward.  Pump prices are falling too, but the downward

price revisions could not, in good conscience, be described as abrupt.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



Just how much longer will the US Federal Reserve continue to raise interest

rates? According to Atlanta Fed president Jack Guynn, fifteen months after

beginning its monetary tightening policy, the board "still has a ways to go."

Where the US economy is concerned, Guynn sticks to his belief that it is "most

likely on a path that will keep us at or near potential growth," despite the

aftereffects of the recent hurricanes. It could be because the aftermath will

trigger a bout of higher inflation that Guynn and the Fed are maintaining their

course. Specifically, Guynn is concerned that higher inflation in the energy

sector will spill over to consumers and adversely affect spending. The evidence?

Year-over-year consumer prices rose 3.6% in August. However, the fourth quarter

appears to have ushered in a more downbeat mood - at least among economists

anyway. According to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter, a panel of

economists surveyed just lowered their third quarter GDP growth estimate from

the 3.6% annualized rate projected in early September to 3.4% today. The fourth

quarter growth projection was also lowered from 3% to 2.9%. Such revisions

aren't entirely surprising, considering that many believe the recent heavy hit

from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is bound to affect the US economy negatively in

the short-term. Despite those downward moves, the full-year growth forecast

remains unchanged at a reasonably healthy 3.5%. However, as the rebuilding

efforts get underway with a vengeance, 2006 economic growth will receive a small

upward shift - from 3.2% to 3.3%.
