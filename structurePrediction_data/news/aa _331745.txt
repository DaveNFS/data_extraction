Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings report for third

quarter 2012 is due to be released on July 24. In the report released this time

last year, the company's earnings performance was lower than the estimates given

by Wall Street, one of the factors is the delayed purchases of customers waiting

for a newer iPhone model. For this quarter, some analysts still think that Apple

will show a lower than estimates' earnings report. For one thing, Apple's new

iPad has begun selling in China on July 21, but many had expected it to ship

last quarter. China is the second biggest market for Apple. In the last quarter,

the company's sales in China were increased threefold to US$7.9 billion,

representing a 20 % of Apple's US$39.2 billion in total revenue. In addition,

the iPhone 5 is only expected to be launched around October this year. By the

end of Monday's trading, shares of Apple dropped US$0.47 per share (equivalent

to 0.08%), where stock prices lowered to US$603.83. The stock traded 17.36

million shares in the last trading session, well above its daily average of

13.02 million shares. Insiderslab.com believes that it is a clever way to check

if insiders like CEOs, CFOs, and Directors in Apple Inc. are starting to buy

more company shares. See insider trade report for AAPL here.
