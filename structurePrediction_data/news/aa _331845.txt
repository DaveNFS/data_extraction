Since inception in 1988, the S&P 500 has outperformed the Zacks #5 Rank List of

Stocks to Sell Now by 80% annually (+2% vs. +10%). While the rest of Wall Street

continued to tout stocks during the market declines of the last few years, Zacks

told investors which stocks to sell or avoid.



Here is a synopsis of why AA and PRGS have a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) and

should most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note

that a #5 Strong Sell rating is applied to 5% of all the stocks in the Zacks

Rank universe:



Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA) announced third-quarter profit of 14 cents per share on

October 12 that missed analysts' expectations by 36.36%. The Zacks Consensus

Estimate for the current year slid to 88 cents per share from $1.20 per share in

the last 30 days as next year's estimate dipped 35 cents per share to $1.03 per

share in that time span.



Progress Software Corporation (Nasdaq: PRGS) posted a third-quarter profit of 20

cents per share on September 27, which came in 4 cents wider than the average

forecast. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year fell to $1.23 per share

from $1.36 per share over the past month. For 2012, analysts expect a profit of

$1.42 per share, compared to last month's projection for a profit of $1.51 per

share.



Here is a synopsis of why WMS and CAKE have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and should

also most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note that

a #4 Sell rating is applied to 15% of all the stocks ranked by Zacks;



WMS Industries Inc. (NYSE: WMS) fourth-quarter profit of 44 cents per share,

posted on August 4, lagged analysts' projections by 16.98%. Estimate for current

year slid 4 cents per share to $1.79 per share over a month as next year's

estimate dipped 6 cents per share to $2.07 per share in that time span.



The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (Nasdaq: CAKE) reported a third-quarter

profit of 36 per share on October 19 that fell 5.26% short of the Zacks

About the Zacks Rank



Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate revisions are the

most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since inception in 1988, #1 Rank

Stocks have generated an average annual return of +28%. During the 2000-2002

bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%, while the S&P 500 tumbled

-37.6%. Also note that the Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell

recommendations (Rank #5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988,

Zacks Rank #5 stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (2.8% versus

+9.7%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage portfolio

trading effectively.
