Report Details



Strong growth in emerging markets is driving the food and drink packaging market

forward. The rising income per capita, increased employment opportunities and

desire to emulate their western counterparts drives the emerging and developing

market consumers to demand more of packaged goods. Visiongain has determined

that the value of the global food and drink packaging market in 2012 will reach

$329.0bn.



The developed regions in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific food and drink

packaging markets have lower growth rates as the markets are saturated and

consumer confidences diminishes due to the euro-zone debt crisis. Nonetheless,

growth in these markets exists for easy-to-open and other convenience features,

which are increasingly demanded by the busy and increasingly aging society. The

technological innovation behind these trends are analysed within this report.
