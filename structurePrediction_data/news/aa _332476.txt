SANTA ANA, Calif., Oct. 27  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- MSC.Software Corp.

(NYSE:MNS), today announced certain financial information for the third quarter

ended September 30, 2004. As previously disclosed, MSC.Software will restate its

financial statements for the periods subsequent to January 1, 2001. Since the

Company is unable to quantify the exact impact of the restatement on its

financial results at this time, the Company can only give limited information

regarding its third quarter results.



Third Quarter Financial Information



During the third quarter, operating expenses totaled $44.5 million, including

expenses related to the Audit Committee's independent review and CFO separation

costs of approximately $3.9 million. Net research and development expense

totaled $7.4 million compared to $6.7 million in the third quarter last year,

and $6.0 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. In the third

quarter, capitalized software totaled $3.2 million compared to $2.6 million in

the third quarter last year and $4.3 million in the second quarter ended June

30, 2004. Sales and marketing expense totaled $18.7 million compared to $18.9

million in the third quarter last year, and $19.1 million in the second quarter

ended June 30, 2004. General and administrative expense, including expenses of

approximately $3.9 million related to the independent review and CFO separation

costs, totaled $16.9 million.  Excluding these expenses in the periods, general

and administrative expense were $13.0 million in the third quarter compared to

$12.3 million in the third quarter last year and $12.4 million in the second

quarter ended June 30, 2004. In the third quarter total other expenses were

$687,000.



Cash and investments at the end of the third quarter stood at $71.8 million

compared to $73.2 million at June 30, 2004 and $57.2 million at March 31, 2004.

Year to date cash flow from operations was $36.3 million. Gross accounts

receivable were $59.8 million at September 30, 2004 compared to $59.0 million at

June 30, 2004 and $75.8 million at March 31, 2004.  Days sales outstanding

(DSOs) were 80 days at September 30, 2004 equal to the DSO's at June 30, 2004

which were also 80 days, and this compares to 100 days at March 31, 2004.



The global sales pipeline, which is the sales management and revenue forecasting

tool that tracks potential customer contracts and engagements, grew to $297

million. There is no assurance that the pipeline amounts will result in executed

contracts or revenues.  In the third quarter, the America's pipeline rose to

$124 million and key software and service transactions were signed with

customers including Northrop, Analex, AMCOR and Alcoa.  In Europe, the pipeline

rose to $81 million and key software and service engagements were signed with

customers including EADS, Leyland, Alenia, Seimens, and Bombardier.  In

Asia-Pacific, the pipeline totaled $92 million and key software and service

contracts were signed with customers including Nissan, Toyota, Hero Honda Motor

(India) and TechTronic Industries (China).



"Virtual Product Development Conferences being conducted in all world regions

have given us the confidence that our solid product strategy supports our

customer requirements and our new business pipeline continues to grow," said

Frank Perna, CEO and Chairman of MSC.Software. "Corporate spending on product

development efficiencies and innovation has positioned MSC's SimOffice,

SimDesigner and SimManager product suites to meet the market's demand for

automation among both large aerospace and automotive companies, as well as

small- and medium-size manufacturers.



"From a financial point of view, our business remains fundamentally sound with

strong cash flows and $72 million in cash and investments on the balance sheet.

This positions us well for the rest of this fiscal year and into 2005,"

continued Mr. Perna.



Status of Independent Review



As previously disclosed, the Company's Audit Committee has been directing an

independent review of certain of the Company's accounting practices and

procedures. The review has principally focused on possible withholding of

information from the Company's independent auditors, the timing of revenue

recognition, the need to restate the Company's revenues for the periods

subsequent to January 1, 2001, and the need to make certain non-cash adjustments

to the Company's financial statements. Management has cooperated fully with the

Audit Committee's review. The Audit Committee believes the independent review is

substantially complete and hopes to receive a report from its advisors before

year end.



Upon delivery of the Company's restated financial statements for January 1, 2001

to December 31, 2003 to its independent auditors and completion of their audits,

the Company expects to file amendments to its Form 10-K's for the years ended

December 31, 2001 and 2002, as well as file its Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2003 and its Form 10-Q's for the subsequent quarters. No estimate

can be given regarding the exact timing of the completion of the process, nor

can any assurances be given that additional revisions or adjustments will not be

required during this process.



Since the Company is unable to quantify the exact impact of the adjustments and

restatement on its financial results at this time, the Company is delaying the

full release of its third quarter results, and the Company's published financial

statements and guidance should not be relied upon at this time.
