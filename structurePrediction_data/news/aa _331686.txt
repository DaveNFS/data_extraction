Aluminum heat transfer composites are mainly used in automobiles, home

appliances, heat exchange systems of machinery and equipment, and air-cooling

systems of thermal power station. On a global basis, the aluminum heat transfer

composites industry has been mature, and several large corporations from the

United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and other countries have monopolized the

global market, which maintains a balance between supply and demand. To further

expand their growth room, these giants have carried out cross-border investments

successively. China has become an investment hotspot with huge development

potentials and a tremendous market size.



In recent years, with the fast-growing downstream sectors, the demand for

aluminum heat transfer composites in China has kept increasing, some local firms

has in succession tapped into such business, and foreign players have also taken

the opportunity to expand capacity aggressively. As of 2011, the annual capacity

of aluminum heat transfer composites in China reached 440,000 tons. In China,

aluminum heat transfer composites find application chiefly in automotive heat

exchangers, and low-end products account for a larger proportion with

overcapacity as yet, while the capacity of aluminum steel composite strips and

other high-end products is limited with a huge supply gap. On the whole, Chinese

aluminum heat transfer composites market is characterized by a structural

imbalance.



At present, China's aluminum rate of heat exchange systems of sedans and

light-duty trucks reaches about 95%, and the market of aluminum heat transfer

composites herein has been saturated. Whereas, the aluminum rate of heat

exchange systems of heavy-duty trucks, new energy vehicles and construction

machinery is still rather low; aluminum radiators have not been popular in the

field of household appliances such as air conditioners, water heaters and

refrigerators, showing huge potential demand for aluminum heat transfer

composites. In the future, under the backdrop of energy conservation and

emission reduction in China, aluminum heat transfer composites will be

popularized in the above-mentioned fields, the demand for aluminum composite

materials used in heavy-duty trucks, new energy automotive heat exchangers,

HVAC, cooling radiators of thermal power stations will be jumbo, and these

products will become investment hotspots.



This report not only expounds the development of global and China aluminum heat

transfer composites industry but also highlights the aluminum heat transfer

composites business of 7 foreign companies (Sapa, ALCOA, Wickeder, Norsk Hydro,

Aleris, Novelis, Kobe Steel) and 16 Chinese peers (like Yinbang, Huafon

Aluminum, Sanyuan Aluminum).



Sapa is the world's largest producer of aluminum profiles, and also one of major

manufacturers of automotive aluminum heat transfer composites (sheets, strips,

foils) in the world. Sapa's Chinese subsidiary Sapa Heat Transfer (Shanghai)

Ltd. mainly produces automotive heat transfer materials. In recent years, Sapa

Shanghai has continuously expanded its production capacity; as of 2011, the

company's capacity had hit 100,000 t/a.



Wickeder is the first European company that conducts the production of composite

metals, as one of the world's largest steel strip suppliers. The company's EMS

Division can produce a variety of composite metal materials. Currently, it is

the world's largest producer of aluminum steel composite strips used in power

stations, holding over 50% share in the global market.



Yinbang, as one of Chinese leaders in aluminum heat transfer composites, has in

recent years continued to increase investment in scientific research and has

successfully developed such high-value-added products as aluminum alloy

composites and aluminum steel composite strips. In 2011, the total capacity of

the company's all products amounted to 75,000 t/a.
