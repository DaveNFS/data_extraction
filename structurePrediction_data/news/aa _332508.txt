MARKET OVERVIEW



Overseas markets are refreshingly positive this morning with all 15 of our

selected group in agreement to the upside. The cumulative average return on the

collective stands at a positive 0.679 percent. Japan's index of leading economic

indicators stood at 80.0 in March, in line with expectations and well ahead of

the boom-bust demarcation level of 50.



The pair of weekly reports on the health of the retail sector pretty well

represents today's economic calendar. On the previous week the ICSC-UBS Store

Sales Index rose by 1.5 percent, while the Redbook Retail Sales for the same

period jumped by a hefty 5.0 percent. The important monthly retail and sales

report will be released on Thursday. That is the report which will hold investor

attention. A key earnings report which many think will be the salvation of the

tech-sector won't be released until after today's market close, at which time

Cisco Systems offers up its third quarter numbers. Analysts currently agree that

the company will report 18-cents per share. That report could well set the mood

for Wednesday's trade.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



As crude oil prices drive relentlessly past $40 a barrel, the global markets ran

for their lives yesterday. Morgan Stanley's Asia-Pacific Index slid 5.5%, as

Japan's Nikkei extended its losing streak to six days with a 554-point plunge

(4.8%). Hong Kong fared little better, sinking 425 points (3.5%). South Korea's

index shed 48 points (5.7%), while Taiwan's exchange lost 215 points (3.5%), and

India's BSE 30 slipped 113 points (2%). The International Energy Agency says a

$10 jump in prices, if sustained over a year, could slice 0.8% from the region's

GDP. That's because several economies depend on oil imports to drive growth. But

the fast-growing Indian economy could suffer most, since it imports 70% of its

oil. Contrastingly, Asia's oil exporting countries like Malaysia and Indonesia

could benefit from higher prices. Elsewhere, the Lundberg Survey says the

average nationwide price for U.S. gasoline rose 10 cents last week to $1.96 per

gallon - the biggest weekly increase since August 2003. British Airways also

warned it may implement a fuel surcharge, as it expects to pay an additional 100

million pounds sterling on fuel costs this year. Even the oil-rich Saudis -

OPEC's largest producer - say $40 oil is a "major concern" and proposed the

cartel raise supplies by 1.5 million barrels per day to prevent a GDP slowdown.

They have the backing of No. 2 producer Iran, plus Kuwait and the UAE. The move

could be ratified at OPEC's June 3 meeting. Christian DeHaemer and Ian Cooper,

investment experts at Taipan's Extreme Volatility Speculator group (EVS), are

profiting from oil's surge. After buying June Puts on Energy Select Sector on

March 9, they sold at the bottom on March 24, giving their investors as much as

150% gains.



The EVS team is up an average of 14% per recommendation in 2004 - simply by

trading on company/industry speculation and "selling the news" when it hits the

mainstream media. To find out more about the EVS group simply follow this link:
