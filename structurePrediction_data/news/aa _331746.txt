DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 16, 2012





Novelis announced today that it will establish a new organization for the

procurement of used beverage cans (UBCs) in North America that will make the

company the largest UBC buyer in the region. The announcement follows the

company's decision to withdraw from its Evermore joint venture with Alcoa

effective August 31, 2012.



Novelis will procure all UBCs for its recycling plants in Greensboro, GA, Berea,

KY, and Oswego, NY, directly through the new organization.



"This move is in line with our global strategy to enhance our scrap procurement

and recycling assets to support our goal of achieving 80% recycled content in

our products by 2020," said Derek Prichett, Vice President, Global Recycling for

Novelis. "The ability to independently control our assets and manage our

business will provide us with more flexibility to execute our strategic plans.

This is the primary driver behind our exit of Evermore."



As the leading recycler of UBCs in North America and the world, Novelis

currently buys the equivalent of 40 billion cans a year, worth an estimated $1

billion. Novelis expects its global consumption of UBCs to grow to more than 60

billion cans by 2015.



Chris Anderson, currently supply chain manager for Evermore, will rejoin Novelis

effective August 1, 2012, to lead the company's new UBC procurement organization

reporting to Silverio Colalancia, Director of Recycling, Novelis North America.

In addition, the company anticipates that a number of current Evermore employees

will join its new Atlanta-based organization, which will include buyers in

strategic locations throughout North America.



Novelis will continue to receive UBCs in North America exclusively through

Evermore until August 31.
