MARYVILLE, Tenn., April 4, 2008 /PRNewswire/ -- Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen

today helped celebrate the grand opening of a fourth manufacturing plant at

DENSO Manufacturing Tennessee (DMTN), Japan-based DENSO Corporation's facility

in Maryville, Tenn. Production has already begun at the new facility.



Tennessee Economic and Community Development Commissioner Matt Kisber joined the

governor, along with numerous state and local officials, including members of

the state legislature and the mayors of Maryville, Alcoa and Blount County.



DMTN currently employs nearly 3,000 people, and hiring for positions in the new

plant will continue through 2010 as production lines are added. DMTN anticipates

500 additional employees by 2010.



"As we continue to expand our operations in Maryville, we prioritize our focus

on providing quality parts for our customers and strengthening our contributions

to the economic well-being of our community," said DMTN President Atsuhiko "Art"

Shimmura. "Today would not have been possible without the cooperation and

commitment we have received from business and government leaders, nor would it

be possible without the dedication and skill of our associates."



The new plant includes production lines transferred from DMTN's existing

electronic products plant and will focus entirely on body electronics: remote

keyless entry, auto air conditioning control units, tire pressure monitoring

systems and body control modules.



DENSO Manufacturing Tennessee, founded in 1988, produces electronic products,

instrument clusters, starters and alternators.
