LENGTH: 412 words



DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 10





FRANKFURT, May 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Almatis is pleased to announce that, at the

end of the period for the solicitation of votes, it has been informed by the

balloting and claims agent, Epiq Bankruptcy Solutions, LLC that 77.4% of voting

holders of its senior first lien debt ("Senior Lenders") by amount and 58.1% by

number have voted to accept its prepackaged Plan of Reorganisation (the "Plan").

The Plan has therefore received in excess of the level of support required for

acceptance of the Plan by Senior Lenders; accepting Senior Lenders included the

members of the coordination committee of the Senior Lenders and funds managed by

Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. A combined hearing to approve the disclosure

statement and confirm the Plan has been set for July 19, 2010.



About Chapter 11



Chapter 11 provides a recognised and practical legal framework to reorganise

over-indebted businesses subject to supervision by the US Bankruptcy Court. The

effect of a Chapter 11 filing is to provide a Company with protection from its

creditors while it develops and implements a plan to reorganize its debt and, if

necessary, its operations. Chapter 11 allows the Company to continue to operate

and maintain its business, under the control of the Company's current management

("in the ordinary course") during the restructuring process. This includes,

among other things, servicing its customers, receiving supplies and paying wages

and salaries to its employees. The process is therefore regularly used by

fundamentally sound operating companies to protect enterprise value as they

reorganise their debt in an orderly process. Almatis has chosen Chapter 11 as

the preferred legal tool for implementing its balance sheet restructuring

following extensive evaluation of available alternatives.
