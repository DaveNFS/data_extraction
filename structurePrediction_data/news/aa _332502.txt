WorkWell Systems Inc. (WorkWell) was presented with ABL Organization's highest

honor, the Platinum ABBY award, at its 2004 Innovation in Healthcare Awards

event here last night.



WorkWell's CEO, George C. Carpenter IV, said, "It's great to have the

affirmation of 120 healthcare CEOs to our enterprise injury prevention model.

Workers Compensation has been a classic 'quality problem,' and the real

innovators in this equation are our clients who partner with us to treat it as

such. Our employees and investors are deeply honored to be in the company of

this great group of finalists, and are appreciative of the great work ABL has

done to recognize advances in healthcare technology."



As Mimi Grant, ABL President and CEO said, "What WorkWell is doing hit a

resonant chord with the attendees, who are equally in shock about how high their

Workers Comp premiums are. In the finish, WorkWell enables the best of all

'health care' ... by avoiding 'injury care' in the first place."
