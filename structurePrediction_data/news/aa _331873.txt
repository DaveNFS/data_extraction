DATELINE: ROSELAND, N.J., Aug. 2, 2011





ADP Â®, a leading provider of human resource outsourcing, payroll services, tax

and compliance services, benefits administration and accounts payable solutions,

today announced that Alcoa has selected the ADP Taxware Enterprise Solutions

platform for its sales and use tax process.



Alcoa recognized ADP's expansive tax content, flexible tax engine and advanced

technology and accordingly selected ADP's Taxware Enterprise to supply the tax

calculations, rates and research services for Alcoa's U.S. operations. The

ability of the ADP Taxware Enterprise Solution to integrate with Alcoa's

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system was another important factor in the

decision.



"After extensive evaluation of the leading tax engine system providers, we

selected ADP Taxware Enterprise because it offers the considerable sales and use

tax functionality that is required for a company the size and complexity of

Alcoa," said Sue Zemba, Manager, State Taxes for Alcoa. "It has been a pleasure

working with ADP and we look forward to continuing the relationship throughout

the implementation process."



The ADP Taxware Enterprise Solution is a transaction tax calculation engine and

dashboard for multinational companies and is available as a hosted or

premise-based solution. It is supported by ADP's staff of tax attorneys and

researchers, which has a deep understanding of local tax requirements and

monitors more than 210 million tax rules and 13,000 rates in 250 countries and

territories. The engine offers pre-built integrations that enable ADP to

exchange data with a wide variety of accounting and ERP systems, including

Intuit, Oracle, Microsoft and SAP. The ADP Taxware Enterprise Solution is

recognized as a Certified Automated Solution by the Streamlined Sales Tax

Governing Board.



"Alcoa is a company with a long history of growth and a strong reputation in

fiscal management," said Kathy Amooi, Corporate Vice President and General

Manager, ADP Compliance and Payment Solutions. "ADP is pleased to provide our

Taxware Enterprise software and service offering as a value-added contribution

to the company's strategic efforts to achieve higher productivity and enhanced

cost containment."
