GONGYI, China, Nov. 9, 2010 /PRNewswire-Asia-FirstCall/ -- China GengSheng

Minerals, Inc. (NYSE Amex: CHGS), a leading China-based high-tech industrial

materials manufacturer producing heat resistant, energy efficient materials for

a variety of industrial applications, today announced that the company has

become an industrial partner with The Federation for International Refractory

Research and Education ("FIRE").



FIRE is a non-profit organization incorporated in Canada, whose members include

ten academic institutions and twelve manufacturers, suppliers, users and other

service providers that are active in the field of refractories and refractory

technologies. FIRE's stated mission is to fund international studies and

research activities in the field of refractories, to support academic education

by promoting student exchanges and generating double (multiple) degree programs,

and to pool the expertise, the experience and the willingness of the most

competent persons, institutions and companies worldwide in the field of

refractories.



"The advancement of the refractory industry requires an ongoing commitment to

the technical education of the workforce, and to open academic and professional

exchange," commented Mr. Shunqing Zhang, China GengSheng's Chairman and Chief

Executive Officer. "As the first Chinese refractory manufacturer accepted for

industrial membership in FIRE, we believe we have a great opportunity to better

understand the developing trends in the global refractory market, exchange ideas

with academic and corporate partners to maintain our technological leadership in

the Chinese refractory market, and leverage networking opportunities to help the

Company gain prominence in the global refractories market. We believe this

partnership, which places GengSheng alongside refractory industry leaders such

as Alcoa, Calderys and RioTinto Alcan, will provide us with technical and other

resources that will help GengSheng advance its position within the Chinese

refractory market and continue to execute on its long-term growth strategy."
