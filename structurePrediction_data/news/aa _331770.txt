Industrial employment in Indiana increased by about one percent over the past

twelve months, according to the 2012 Indiana Manufacturers Directory®, a

manufacturers directory published annually by Manufacturers' News, Inc. (MNI)

2011 and March 2012.

"Following several years of job losses, Indiana is finally seeing a renaissance

in its manufacturing sector," says Tom Dubin, President of the Evanston,

IL-based publishing company, which has been surveying industry since 1912. "The

state's friendly business environment and solid infrastructure have been a draw

for a variety of enterprises, particularly in the auto sector."



Bright spots for the state included Alcoa's plans to open a new aluminum plant

near Lafayette; the expansion of spool-molder Mossberg Industries in Garrett;

ConAgra's plans to expand its popcorn plant in Rensselaer; the expansion of

Belstra Milling's animal feed plant in DeMotte; and the opening of Progress

Rail's locomotive manufacturing plant in Muncie. In addition, Honda has added a

second shift at its Greensburg facility; Toyota will expand production at its

plant in Princeton; auto-supplier Flex N Gate is expanding its Covington

factory; Subaru plans to expand production at its location in Lafayette; and

Busche Enterprise will expand its factory in Albion.

2.3% over the year. Industrial machinery and equipment ranks second with 69,757

jobs, up 1.9%. Third-ranked fabricated metals account for 54,804 jobs, up a half
