MARKET OVERVIEW



Overseas markets are holding up reasonably well this morning as currently 11 of

the 15 markets that we track are in positive territory. The cumulative average

return on the collective stands at a positive 0.324 percent. The Nikkei closed

out its first trading week of the New Year in fine fashion, adding over 127

points overnight. During the session, the index breached the 11,000 level

(intraday high of 11008.60) for the first time since October 22. On the week,

the index was higher by 2.7 percent. Turning towards our friends north of the

border, the number of workers employed in Canada rose by 53,000. The rise came

on top of the 54,100 increase in November. The unemployment rate declined to 7.4

percent from the 7.5 percent posed in the prior month.



The purported crown jewel of the economic recovery which has yet to be firmly

embedded into the tiara of the recent cycle of expansion, the December Non-Farm

Payrolls report will be released before the market open today. Analysts

currently expect December to have delivered 150,000 new non-farm jobs on top of

the surprisingly disappointing 57,000 rise in November. The 150K figure sounds

good, but the economy has to do better to assure continuation of the trend in

growth. The companion report, the December Unemployment Rate is seen holding

steady at 5.9 percent; matching November's 5.9 percent rate. This report has the

ability to move the market, so if there is a surprise, let it be to the upside

(maybe to 200,000). Alcoa kicked off this earnings season in fine fashion

reporting fourth-quarter net income of $291 million, or 33 cents per share (39

cents on a continuous operations basis). In the same quarter a year ago, AA

reported a loss of $223 million, or 26 cents per share. Revenue rose to $5.53

billion, from $5.1 billion a year earlier. The operating result of 0.39 beat the

consensus estimates of polled analysts of 34 cents per share and revenue of

$5.47 billion.

DYNAMIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES



Thinking Small About Big Profits: The next big revolution is imminent, and noted

Red Zone financial investment experts Christian DeHaemer and Ian L. Cooper are

digging for some pure, profitable plays prior to that revolution. In an alert

sent to investors, they state: "With the Bush Administration ushering in $4US

billion for nanotech research over the next four years, world governments

tripping over one another to get in, and the National Science Foundation

estimating that the global market for nanotech could reach $1US trillion by

2015, who wouldn't be a buyer?" In fact, with recent volume spikes and today's

news of a new patent for its plasma nano-particle processes to prepare

nanocrystalline materials with controlled surface chemistry, Nanophase

Technologies Corporation is one of those pure plays that stands to benefit the

most from the forthcoming "nano-boom." It's already on the way. The stock has

risen from DeHaemer and Cooper's $6US.75 entry price to its current $10US.78 --

a 54% jump. It remains a strong buy.
