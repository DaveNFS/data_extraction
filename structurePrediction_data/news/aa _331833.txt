Since inception in 1988, the S&P 500 has outperformed the Zacks #5 Rank List of

Stocks to Sell Now by 80% annually (+2% vs. +10%). While the rest of Wall Street

continued to tout stocks during the market declines of the last few years, Zacks

told investors which stocks to sell or avoid.



Here is a synopsis of why SIRO and AA have a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) and

should most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note

that a #5 Strong Sell rating is applied to 5% of all the stocks in the Zacks

Rank universe:



Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SIRO) announced fourth-quarter profit of 56

cents per share on November 18 that missed analysts' expectations by 9.68%. The

Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year slid to $3.19 per share from $3.33

per share in the last 30 days as next year's estimate dipped 5 cents per share

to $3.53 per share in that time span.



Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA) posted a third-quarter profit of 14 cents per share on

October 12, which came in 8 cents wider than the average forecast. The Zacks

Consensus Estimate for the full year fell to 86 cents per share from 88 cents

per share over the past month. For 2012, analysts expect a profit of $1 per

share, compared to last month's projection for a profit of $1.03 per share.



Here is a synopsis of why LRN and MNRO have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and should

also most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note that

a #4 Sell rating is applied to 15% of all the stocks ranked by Zacks;



K12 Inc. (NYSE: LRN) first-quarter profit of 18 cents per share, posted on

November 15, lagged analysts' projections by 28%. Estimate for current year slid

15 cents per share to 72 cents per share over a month as next year's estimate

dipped 7 cents per share to $1.14 per share in that time span.



Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. (Nasdaq: MNRO) reported a second-quarter profit of 47

cents per share on October 20 that fell 2.08% short of the Zacks Consensus

Estimate. The full-year average forecast is currently $1.71 per share, compared

with last two month's projection of $1.75 per share. Next year's forecast

dropped to $1.99 per share from $2.04 per share in the same period.

About the Zacks Rank



Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate revisions are the

most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since inception in 1988, #1 Rank

Stocks have generated an average annual return of +28%. During the 2000-2002

bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%, while the S&P 500 tumbled

-37.6%. Also note that the Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell

recommendations (Rank #5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988,

Zacks Rank #5 stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (2.8% versus

+9.7%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage portfolio

trading effectively.
