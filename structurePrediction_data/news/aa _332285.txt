Inside Counsel, a monthly magazine published specifically for general counsel

and other top in-house legal professionals hailed Mr. Flexner as "The specialist

for high-stakes antitrust defense, because he knows antitrust inside and out --

literally."  The magazine dubbed him "a neurosurgeon -- or rather the

neurosurgeon -- the miracle worker you want to see when you wake up in traction

and you can't feel anything below the tracheotomy."  The accolade was the result

of the magazine's poll of inside counsel, law firms, and legal consultants, as

well as Inside Counsel independent research.  Flexner's antitrust clients

include Alcoa, American Express, AT&T, Northwest Airlines and DuPont.



"Don Flexner is an outstanding counselor and an outstanding litigator," said the

Firm's Chairman, David Boies.
