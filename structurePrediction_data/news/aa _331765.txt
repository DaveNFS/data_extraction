LENGTH: 297 words



DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12, 2012





The U.S.-Russia Business Council (USRBC), the U.S.-based trade association

leading the organized U.S. business community campaign for Russia's removal from

the Jackson-Vanik amendment and enactment of Permanent Normal Trade Relations

(PNTR) with Russia, applauded today's introduction of legislation by Senators

Max Baucus (D-MT), John Thune (R-SD), John Kerry (D-MA) and John McCain (R-AZ)

on Russia's graduation from the 1970s-era Jackson-Vanik law and approval of

Russia PNTR.



"We are pleased to see this action by a bipartisan group of Senators. This will

help ensure that U.S. businesses benefit fully from Russia's pending WTO

accession," said Klaus Kleinfeld, USRBC Chairman and Chairman and CEO of Alcoa,

Inc. "The timely introduction of this legislation is an important first step

towards ensuring that U.S. businesses can stay competitive in the Russian

market."



"The USRBC and the Coalition for U.S.-Russia Trade, for which USRBC serves as

the Secretariat, urges the Obama Administration and Congressional leadership to

enable passage of Russia PNTR by the August recess," said USRBC President and

CEO Edward Verona. "We are committed to working constructively with all

stakeholders towards successful passage of this legislation."



The U.S.-Russia Business Council (USRBC) represents the interests of its 250

U.S. and Russian member companies, providing business development and government

relations support in both Moscow and Washington. The USRBC contributes to the

stability and development of a free market in Russia and supports Russia's

integration into the global economy. It also serves as the Secretariat for the

Coalition for U.S.-Russia Trade (www.usrussiatrade.org). For more information,
