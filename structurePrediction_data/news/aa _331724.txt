The Rexam Chicago office recently hosted its second annual "Cans for Cash"

recycling event to promote recycling and raise money for charity. Rexam

partnered with United Scrap Metal, a local recycler, and was supported by other

key partners including Tri-Arrows Aluminum Inc., Novelis and Alcoa.



More than 1,650 pounds of aluminum cans were collected at the weekend event

which also raised more than $1,000 for the Ronald McDonald House Charities of

Chicago and Northwest Indiana.



The aluminum can is the most recycled beverage package in the world, and events

like these are aimed at increasing the recycling rate and highlighting the

sustainability benefits of the aluminum beverage can. In 2011, the U.S.

recycling rate for aluminum beverage containers jumped seven percentage points

to 65.1 percent, the highest level in 14 years.



"Everyone came together to set a positive example for our community," said Rich

Grimley, president and CEO, Rexam Beverage Can North America. "We are showing

that the beverage can is the best environmental and sustainability option in the

beverage industry. Thanks to our employees, our supplier partners and people

from the community, we were able to more than double our results from last year.

We will continue to drive recycling efforts through community events like this

one, demonstrating the easy connection between beverage cans, recycling and

charity."
