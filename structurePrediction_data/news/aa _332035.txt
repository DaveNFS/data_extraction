OWEGO, N.Y., Aug. 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin's (NYSE: LMT) first four

operational Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) prototypes, featuring at least

one prototype in each vehicle category and including two variants of the

Category B model, have successfully exceeded 50,000 combined miles of testing.

To best simulate mission conditions, the prototypes are undergoing 2,000 miles

of rigorous secondary and off-road testing weekly.

"From the time we formed our JLTV Team more than four years ago, one of our

standing objectives has been to literally drive risk out of the JLTV program,"

said Lou DeSantis, vice president of JLTV Systems at Lockheed Martin. "Through

prototyping and off-road testing, we're doing just that. Surpassing the 50,000

test mile threshold emphasizes our commitment to delivering a mature, low-risk

family of vehicles for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as quickly as possible,

and also speaks volumes to the hard work and dedication of our entire JLTV

Team."



Lockheed Martin's current JLTV family of vehicles includes four prototypes, all

of which are in system test:



The original Infantry Carrier JLTV Category B model, which is designed for troop

transportation and was unveiled in October 2007;The Utility Vehicle Light

Category C model, which is designed with a focus on payload and was introduced

in February 2008;The General Purpose Mobility Category A model, which is

designed for logistical support and was unveiled in October 2008; andThe second

variant of the Infantry Carrier Category B model, which made its public debut at

the Association of the United States Army Winter Symposium in February 2009.



The Lockheed Martin-led JLTV Team includes leaders in their respective fields.

The BAE Systems Global Tactical Systems and Security & Survivability Systems

businesses are providing production facilities for high volume assembly,

automotive design support and advanced armor solutions for protection. Alcoa

Defense is supplying materials experience, design services and aluminum

components that give the vehicle its structural strength at reduced weight. JWF

-- Defense Systems is offering state-of-the-art machining and cost-effective

fabrication. Lockheed Martin serves as the prime contractor and design agent,

providing systems engineering, platform integration, design expertise, and

program and supply chain management.
