Dow Jones reported that Viacom Inc lost another battle on Thursday in its efforts to force Google Inc's YouTube to pay for alleged unauthorized posting of Viacom content. For a second time, U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton threw out Viacom's $1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit, a year after a federal appeals court revived the case. The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals instructed the judge to determine if YouTube had knowledge or awareness of specific infringing material and whether it willfully blinded itself to that specific content. Viacom sued YouTube, claiming the site allowed users to post copyrighted Viacom content without permission between 2005 and 2008, including content from Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show', 'The Colbert Report' and 'South Park'. Despite the ongoing litigation, a number of Viacom units, including Paramount Pictures and Comedy Central, have entered into deals to create channels on YouTube. The court case centers on YouTube's practices in the early days of video sharing, mostly before 2008. Viacom has said it pursued the lawsuit because it is interested in establishing a precedent.?
