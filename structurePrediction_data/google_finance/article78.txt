Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)?is a Mountain View, California based multinational corporation that specializes in Internet-related products and services. The Internet giant has a variety of services including search engines, online advertising, cloud computing, and software. Google announced its substandard third quarter report on Thursday, October 16th, making this the fourth consecutive quarter in which the company has fallen short on earnings expectations.
In its Q3 results, Google reported $6.35 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis, falling short of analysts¡¯ expectations of $6.53 by $0.18. During the same quarter last year, the Internet giant posted $5.63 earnings per share. The company earned revenue of $16.52 billion, compared to the analysts¡¯ consensus estimate of $16.59 billion. Google¡¯s quarterly revenue went up 20.0% on a year-over-year basis. On average, analysts expect Google will post $25.66 earnings per share for the current fiscal year.

Despite the cost increase, Google did not seem too distraught by the underwhelming Q3 report. CFO Patrick Pichette noted ¡°Google had another strong performance this quarter, with revenue up 20% year on year, at $16.5 billion. We continue to be excited about the growth in our advertising and emerging businesses.¡±
