Reuters reported that Brazil is investigating Google Inc for anticompetitive practices alleged by Microsoft Corp and Brazilian rivals. Brazilian antitrust watchdog Cade said on October 11, 2013 it is looking into accusations that Google has unfairly used rivals' content, discouraged their advertisers and favored its own product listings in search results. Microsoft filed a complaint charging Google with obstructing advertising campaigns across multiple search engines, giving an unfair advantage to Google's profitable AdWords service, according to a Cade statement. Brazilian comparison shopping sites Buscap¨¦ and Bondfardo accused Google of reproducing product reviews from their users - a practice known as scraping - without allowing the competitors to do the same with its website Google Shopping. Cade is also looking into complaints from Buscap¨¦ and Bondfardo that Google gives unfair prominence to Google Shopping on its general Web search, making it the only price-comparison tool that appears with photos, prices and evaluations.?
