Dow Jones reported that Google Inc's agreement with U.S. regulators to limit how it can wield its technology patents, the Company has dropped a pending patent claim against Microsoft Corp. Google on Tuesday asked the U.S. International Trade Commission, a federal body that frequently tackles patent disputes, to drop claims that Microsoft was infringing two patents held by Google's Motorola Mobility unit. The ITC claims date to 2010, before Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility. Last week, as part of an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to end an investigation into Google's potential violations of antitrust law, Google made pledges about how it would handle disputes over "standard essential patents," or patents that cover broad areas of technology such as how to deliver online video to mobile devices. In these disputes, Google agreed to limits on when it could ask a court to block sales of competing companies' products.?
