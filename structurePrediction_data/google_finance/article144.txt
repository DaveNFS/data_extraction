Reuters reported that Google Inc to modify how it displays Internet search results could settle a long-running antitrust dispute with the European Union. The Company's search engine has been under investigation for three years by the European Commission, which acts as the bloc's antitrust regulator, over complaints it was blocking competitors in search results. Google proposed concessions in September, hoping to end a case which could otherwise lead to a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue, or $5 billion.?
