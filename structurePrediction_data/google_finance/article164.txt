Reuters reported that Google Inc and its Motorola Mobility unit struck back on February 13, 2013 against BT Group Plc, filing patent lawsuits against the British telecommunications group more than a year after BT launched its own lawsuit against Google. BT, Britain's dominant fixed-line telecoms group, sued Google in 2011 over six patents related to mobile technology. But in a lawsuit filed on February 13, 2013 in a California federal court, Google asserted four patents of its own. Google spokeswoman Niki Fenwick said the company also filed a separate lawsuit against BT in a U.K. court. A BT representative said the company does not comment on pending litigation.?
