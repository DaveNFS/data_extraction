Amazon Conference Showcases Another Side of the Retailer¡¯s Business

Amazon is inviting tech-savvy customers to climb its Elastic Beanstalk.
That¡¯s just one of the arcane offerings Amazon.com will highlight at its third annual cloud computing conference, which starts in earnest on Wednesday in Las Vegas. The confab is the company¡¯s splashy push to build its business providing online access to data storage, number-crunching and?web-app hosting (that¡¯s the Elastic Beanstalk) on a pay-as-you-go basis, all running on Amazon¡¯s computer servers.
Amazon Web Services re:Invent, as the conference is known, is expected to draw 13,500 attendees over the next three days, up from 9,000 last year. It has grown to be one of the bigger such conferences and a can¡¯t-miss for startups.
¡°The crowd is growing because AWS is being used seriously by more and more organizations,¡± said Lydia Leong, a Gartner analyst who is attending the conference this year.
Indeed, Andy Jassy, the AWS chief, is set to announce during his keynote address on Wednesday that Amazon now counts more than 1 million businesses and government agencies among its customers. The company has previously said its active customers numbered in the hundreds of thousands.
Jassy declined in an interview to disclose AWS annual revenue, nor would he say whether the unit is profitable. Analysts estimate AWS generates at least $4 billion a year in sales.
AWS re:Invent, which features nearly 300 sessions and a keynote address from Werner Vogels, Amazon¡¯s chief technologist, is not meant to drum up new business, Jassy said. ¡°This is not a sales and marketing conference for us, it really is an education conference.¡±
At the conference, Amazon is expected to announce new services aimed at large corporations as well as price reductions. AWS has cut the price of various cloud computing services 46 times since it was formed in 2006, said Jassy. Amazon will likely announce a partnership with Docker, a developer of so-called container technology that encloses computer programs in a layer of software that connects seamlessly to the operating system and other computing resources, analysts said.
¡°The vast majority of companies will not own their own data centers in the fullness of time,¡± said Jassy. ¡°All that computing is moving to the cloud. This space is going to be a high-volume, relatively low-margin business.¡±
Intuit Inc., which sells tax preparation software, is taking steps in that direction. The company will announce a plan to use AWS for all its customer-facing applications, though internal applications will run on its own servers for now. ¡°The primary reason is developer speed,¡± said Intuit Chief Technology Officer Tayloe Stansbury. ¡°Working with AWS allows us to innovate faster for our customers.¡±
Many AWS customers say it allows them to test their own services at a lower cost than operating their own data centers.
That has brought Amazon stiff competition from rivals offering similar services, primarily Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. The trio has slashed prices and poached employees from one another in an effort to bolster their share of a market that research firm IDC expects to more than double from $56.6 billion this year to $127 billion by 2018.
¡°Google is an extremely strong contender against Amazon,¡± said Sebastian Stadil, CEO of Scalr, which helps companies manage their cloud computing services.
Amazon announced plans last month to open a data center in Germany to be closer to European customers and to maintain its lead there. And Amazon now has a ¡°significant¡± sales team designed to sell cloud computing services to larger corporations, said Jassy, declining to give specifics.
As well, Amazon is negotiating tax breaks to build a new data center near Columbus, Ohio, which is expected to cost at least $1.1 billion. Rival Microsoft earlier this year said it is expanding a data center complex in Iowa at about the same cost.
Jassy said he had no details to share about Amazon¡¯s plans in Ohio.
