Analyst: Google A Long Term Secular Winner, But Don't Get Overly Excited

Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Google Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) earlier this week with an Equal-weight rating and a $600 price target.
¡°Google fends off a ¡®law of large numbers' issues in core search by ramping investment spend,¡± Swinburne wrote in his initiation note. ¡°Google is a long-term secular winner, but estimates appear high and diversification is proving expensive.¡±
Google's third quarter results proved to show investors that the company is undergoing a slowing search growth in mature markets, including the U.S. and U.K. Swinburne cautions that despite slowing search growth, revenue estimates appear to be ¡°aggressive¡± in 2015. In addition, the analyst also states that mobile search growth is not sustaining overall search growth rates.

According to Swinburne, capital spending, R&D and stock comp have doubled from $11 billion in 2012, representing 29 percent of net revenue to $22 billion in 2014, representing 42 percent of net revenue. The analyst notes that these investments ¡°should bear fruit over time¡± but the company's returns from new ventures ¡°are unlikely to reach the level of its core search business suggesting margins could be under pressure for some time.¡±
Bottom line: Swinburne is a ¡°believer¡± in Google's long-term prospects, but advises investors to ¡°look for a better entry point.¡±
