Reuters reported that internal emails show that executives at tech companies such as Apple Inc and Google Inc believed that an agreement to refrain from poaching each other's workers would bring real financial benefits, a U.S. judge said. Five former employees of various tech companies have filed a civil lawsuit against Apple, Google, Intel Corp and others, alleging an illegal conspiracy to eliminate competition for each other's employees. At a hearing in San Jose, California federal court on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh also ordered Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to be questioned by plaintiff attorneys for four hours.?
