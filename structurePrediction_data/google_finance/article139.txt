Reuters reported that EU regulators have asked 125 Google Inc rivals and third parties to provide feedback on the company's second attempt to settle a three-year-long antitrust investigation and avert a possible $5 billion fine.

That prompted the EU antitrust authority to demand fresh concessions from the U.S. company.?
