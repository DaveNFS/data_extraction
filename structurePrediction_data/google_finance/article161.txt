Reuters reported that Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit will slash 1,200 jobs or 10% of its workforce as the smartphone maker tries to return to profitability, the Wall Street Journal reported. The layoffs come on top of 4,000 jobs Google eliminated at Motorola Mobility in August as the Internet search giant seeks to make more smartphones and fewer simple handsets.
