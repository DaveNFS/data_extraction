Reuters reported that Google Inc is working with recently acquired Motorola on a handset codenamed "X-phone", aimed at grabbing market share from Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the Wall Street Journal reported. Google acquired Motorola in May for $12.5 billion to bolster its patent portfolio as its Android mobile operating system competes with Apple and Samsung. Motorola is working on two fronts: devices that will be sold by carrier partner Verizon Wireless, and on the X phone. Motorola plans to enhance the X Phone with its recent acquisition of Viewdle, an imaging and gesture-recognition software developer. The new handset is due out sometime next year, the business daily said, citing a person familiar with the plans. Motorola is also expected to work on an "X" tablet after the phone.?
